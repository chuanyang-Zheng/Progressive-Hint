Question: there were 35 students in a hostel . due to the admission of 7 new students the expenses of the mess were increased by rs . 84 per day while the average expenditure per head diminished by re 1 . what was the original expenditure of the mess ? (Hint: The answer is near to (d)).
Options: (a) rs 450 (b) rs 920 (c) rs 550 (d) rs . 630 (e) none of these
A: We know the Answer Hints: (d). With the Answer Hints: (d), we will answer the question.
Let's think step by step
let the original average expenditure be rs . x
then , 42 ( x - 1 ) - 35 x = 84\,7 x = 126
x = 18
therefore original expenditure = rs . ( 35 * 18 ) = rs . 630.
The answer is (d), rs . 630

Question: a train 200 m long passes a man , running at 5 km / hr in the same direction in which the train is going , in 10 seconds . the speed of the train is ? (Hint: The answer is near to (c)).
Options: (a) 28 (b) 50 (c) 77 (d) 22 (e) 12
A: We know the Answer Hints: (c). With the Answer Hints: (c), we will answer the question.
Let's think step by step
speed of the train relative to man = ( 200 / 10 ) m / sec = ( 20 ) m / sec.
[ ( 20 ) * ( 18 / 5 ) ] km / hr = 72 km / hr.
let the speed of the train be x km / hr.
then , relative speed = ( x - 5 ) km / hr.
x - 5 = 72, x = 77 km / hr .
The answer is (c), 77

Question: solution x contains 20 % of material a and 80 % of material b . solution y contains 30 % of material a and 70 % of material b . a mixture of both these solutions contains 22 % of material a in the final product . how much solution x is present in the mixture ? (Hint: The answer is near to (a)).
Options: (a) 40 % (b) 60 % (c) 80 % (d) 100 % (e) 110 %
A: We know the Answer Hints: (a). With the Answer Hints: (a), we will answer the question.
Let's think step by step
we can assume the total weight of the mixture = 100
conc of a in the final mixture = 22
let weight of a in the mixture be x.
conc given = 20% = 0.2
therefore , weight of b = 100 - x.
conc given = 30% = 0.3
now , accordding to the problem, 0.2 x + 0.3 ( 100 - x ) = 22
solving , we get x = 80
since we assumed the weight of the mixture = 100, therefore presence of a in the mixture = 80%.
The answer is (c), 80%

Question: a trader sells 40 metres of cloth for rs . 8200 at a profit of rs . 35 per metre of cloth . how much profit will the trder earn on 40 metres of cloth ? (Hint: The answer is near to (c)).
Options: (a) rs . 950 (b) rs . 1500 (c) rs . 1000 (d) rs . 1400 (e) none of these
A: We know the Answer Hints: (c). With the Answer Hints: (c), we will answer the question.
Let's think step by step
price of 1 metre cloth = 8200 / 40 = rs 205
cost of 1 metre cloth = rs 205 – 35 = rs 170
cost on 40 metres = 170 x 40 = rs . 6800
profit earned on 40 metres cloth = rs . 8200 – rs . 6800 = rs . 1400
The answer is (d), rs . 1400

Question: if x < y < z and y - x > 5 , where x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers , what is the least possible value s of z - x ? (Hint: The answer is near to (a), (c)).
Options: (a) 6 (b) 7 (c) 8 (d) 9 (e) 10
A: We know the Answer Hints: (a), (c). With the Answer Hints: (a), (c), we will answer the question.
Let's think step by step
We know x < y < z
to find the least possible value for z - x, we need to find the values for z and x that can be closest to each other.
if x is some even number, then what could be minimum possible odd z.
if x is some even number, y - x > 5 ; y > x + 5
minimum value for y = x + 5 + 2 = x + 7
(note : x + 5 is as even + odd = odd and nearest odd greater than x + 5 is x + 5 + 2)
minimum value for z = y + 2 = x + 7 + 2 = x + 9
(note : z = y + 2 because both z and y are odd, difference between two odd numbers is 2)
s = z - x = x + 9 - x = 9
The answer is (d), 9

Question: what is the difference between the c . i . on rs . 6000 for 1 1 / 2 years at 4 % per annum compounded yearly and half - yearly ? (Hint: The answer is near to (e), (d)).
Options: (a) s . 2.04 (b) s . 2.08 (c) s . 2.02 (d) s . 2.83 (e) s . 2.45
A: We know the Answer Hints: (e), d). With the Answer Hints: (e), (d), we will answer the question.
Let's think step by step
c . i . when interest is compounded yearly = [ 6000 * ( 1 + 4 / 100 ) * ( 1 + ( 1 / 2 * 4 ) / 100 ] = 6000 * 26 / 25 * 51 / 50 = rs . 6364.8
c . i . when interest is compounded half - yearly = [ 6000 * ( 1 + 2 / 100 ) 2 ] = ( 6000 * 51 / 50 * 51 / 50 * 51 / 50 ) = rs . 6367.25
difference = ( 6367.25 - 6364.8 ) = rs . 2.45.
The answer is (e), s . 2.45

Question: the average weight of a , b and c is 45 kg . if the average weight of a and b be 40 kg and that of b and c be 45 kg , then the weight of b is : (Hint: The answer is near to (d), (b)).
Options: (a) 31 kg (b) 32 kg (c) 33 kg (d) 35 kg (e) none of these
A: We know the Answer Hints: (d), (b). With the Answer Hints: (d), (b), we will answer the question.
Let's think step by step
let a , b , c represent their respective weights.
then , we have : a + b + c = ( 45 x 3 ) = 135 … ( i )
a + b = ( 40 x 2 ) = 80 … ( ii )
b + c = ( 45 x 2 ) = 90 … ( iii )
adding ( ii ) and ( iii ), we get : a + 2 b + c = 170 … ( iv )
subtracting ( i ) from ( iv ), we get : b = 35.
b’ s weight = 35 kg .
The answer is (d), 35 kg

Question: the compound and the simple interests on a certain sum at the same rate of interest for two years are rs . 11730 and rs . 10200 respectively . find the sum (Hint: The answer is near to (e), (c)).
Options: (a) rs . 17037 (b) rs . 17000 (c) rs . 17276 (d) rs . 170287 (e) rs . 171881
A: We know the Answer Hints: (e), (c). With the Answer Hints: (e), (c), we will answer the question.
Let's think step by step
the simple interest for the first year is 10200 / 2 is rs . 5100
and compound interest for first year also is rs . 5100.
the compound interest for second year on rs . 5100 for one year
so rate of the interest = ( 100 * 1530 ) / ( 5100 * 1 ) = 30% p
so p = ( 100 * 10200 ) / ( 30 * 2 ) = rs . 17000
The answer is (b), rs . 17000
