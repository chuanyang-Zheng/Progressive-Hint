Q: John found that the average of 15 numbers is 40. If 10 is added to each number then the mean of the numbers is? (Hint: The answer is near to (a)).
Answer Choices: (a) 50 (b) 45 (c) 65 (d) 78 (e) 64
A: We know the Answer Hints: (a). With the Answer Hints: (a), we will answer the question. If 10 is added to each number, then the mean of the numbers also increases by 10. So the new mean would be 50. The answer is (a).

Q: If a / b = 3/4 and 8a + 5b = 22,then find the value of a. (Hint: The answer is near to (b)).
Answer Choices: (a) 1/2 (b) 3/2 (c) 5/2 (d) 4/2 (e) 7/2
A: We know the Answer Hints: (b). With the Answer Hints: (b), we will answer the question. a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is (b).

Q: A person is traveling at 20 km/hr and reached his destiny in 2.5 hr then find the distance? (Hint: The answer is near to (d), (c)).
Answer Choices: (a) 53 km (b) 55 km (c) 52 km (d) 60 km (e) 50 km
A: We know the Answer Hints: (d), (c). With the Answer Hints: (d), (c), we will answer the question. The distance that the person traveled would have been 20 km/hr * 2.5 hrs = 50 km. The answer is (e).

Q: How many keystrokes are needed to type the numbers from 1 to 500? (Hint: The answer is near to (a)).
Answer Choices: (a) 1156 (b) 1392 (c) 1480 (d) 1562 (e) 1788
A: We know the Answer Hints: (a). With the Answer Hints: (a), we will answer the question. There are 9 one-digit numbers from 1 to 9. There are 90 two-digit numbers from 10 to 99. There are 401 three-digit numbers from 100 to 500. 9 + 90(2) + 401(3) = 1392. The answer is (b).

Answer Choices: (a) 1156 (b) 1392 (c) 1480 (d) 1562 (e) 1788
A: We know the Answer Hints: (b), (a). With the Answer Hints: (b), (a), we will answer the question. There are 9 one-digit numbers from 1 to 9. There are 90 two-digit numbers from 10 to 99. There are 401 three-digit numbers from 100 to 500. 9 + 90(2) + 401(3) = 1392. The answer is (b).
