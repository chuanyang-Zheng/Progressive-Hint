    "problem": "Let $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ $d,$ and $e$ be the distinct roots of the equation $x^5 + 7x^4 - 2 = 0.$  Find\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\frac{a^5}{(a - b)(a - c)(a - d)(a - e)} + \\frac{b^5}{(b - a)(b - c)(b - d)(b - e)} \\\\\n&\\quad + \\frac{c^5}{(c - a)(c - b)(c - d)(c - e)} + \\frac{d^5}{(d - a)(d - b)(d - c)(d - e)} \\\\\n&\\quad + \\frac{e^5}{(e - a)(e - b)(e - c)(e - d)}.\n\\end{align*}",

    "solution": "Consider the polynomial\n\\begin{align*}\np(x) &= \\frac{a^5 (x - b)(x - c)(x - d)(x - e)}{(a - b)(a - c)(a - d)(a - e)} + \\frac{b^5 (x - a)(x - c)(x - d)(x - e)}{(b - a)(b - c)(b - d)(b - e)} \\\\\n&\\quad + \\frac{c^5 (x - a)(x - b)(x - d)(x - e)}{(c - a)(c - b)(c - d)(c - e)} + \\frac{d^5 (x - a)(x - b)(x - c)(x - e)}{(d - a)(d - b)(d - c)(d - e)} \\\\\n&\\quad + \\frac{e^5 (x - a)(x - b)(x - c)(x - d)}{(e - a)(e - b)(e - c)(e - d)}.\n\\end{align*}Note that $p(x)$ is a polynomial of degree at most 4.  Also, $p(a) = a^5,$ $p(b) = b^5,$ $p(c) = c^5,$ $p(d) = d^5,$ and $p(e) = e^5.$  This might lead us to conclude that $p(x) = x^5,$ but as we just observed, $p(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 4.\n\nSo, consider the polynomial\n\\[q(x) = x^5 - p(x).\\]The polynomial $q(x)$ becomes 0 at $x = a,$ $b,$ $c,$ $d,$ and $e.$  Therefore,\n\\[q(x) = x^5 - p(x) = (x - a)(x - b)(x - c)(x - d)(x - e) r(x)\\]for some polynomial $r(x).$\n\nSince $p(x)$ is a polynomial of degree at most 4, $q(x) = x^5 - p(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 5.  Furthermore, the leading coefficient is 1.  Therefore, $r(x) = 1,$ and\n\\[q(x) = x^5 - p(x) = (x - a)(x - b)(x - c)(x - d)(x - e).\\]Then\n\\[p(x) = x^5 - (x - a)(x - b)(x - c)(x - d)(x - e),\\]which expands as\n\\[p(x) = (a + b + c + d + e) x^4 + \\dotsb.\\]This is important, because the expression given in the problem is the coefficient of $x^4$ in $p(x).$  Hence, the expression given in the problem is equal to $a + b + c + d + e.$  By Vieta's formulas, this is $\\boxed{-7}.$"
