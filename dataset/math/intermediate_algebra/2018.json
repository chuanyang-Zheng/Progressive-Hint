    "problem": "There are nonzero integers $a$, $b$, $r$, and $s$ such that the complex number $r+si$ is a zero of the polynomial $P(x)={x}^{3}-a{x}^{2}+bx-65$. For each possible combination of $a$ and $b$, let ${p}_{a,b}$ be the sum of the zeros of $P(x)$. Find the sum of the ${p}_{a,b}$'s for all possible combinations of $a$ and $b$.",

    "solution": "Since the coefficients of $P(x)$ are real, if $r+si$ is a zero, then so is $r-si$. To avoid counting pairs of roots twice, we stipulate that $s > 0$.\n\nLetting $t$ denote the third root, we note that by Vieta's formulas, \\[a = (r+si) + (r-si) + t = 2r + t,\\]so $t = a - 2r$, which is an integer. By Vieta again, \\[65 =(r+si)(r-si)t = (r^2+s^2)t,\\]so $r^2+s^2$ must be a positive divisor of $65$. Testing cases, we find that the possible values for $(r, s)$ are $(\\pm 1, 2)$, $(\\pm 2, 1)$, $(\\pm 2, 3)$, $(\\pm 3, 2)$, $(\\pm 1, 8)$, $(\\pm 8, 1)$, $(\\pm 7, 4)$, and $(\\pm 4, 7)$.\n\nNow, given $r$ and $s$, we determine $p_{a, b}$. By Vieta's again, \\[p_{a, b} = (r+si) + (r-si) + t = 2r + t = 2r + \\frac{65}{r^2+s^2}.\\]Over all possible pairs $(r, s)$, the $2r$ terms all cancel with each other. Looking at the list of possible pairs $(r, s)$, we get that the sum of all the $p_{a, b}$'s is \\[4 \\left(\\frac{65}{1^2+2^2} + \\frac{65}{2^2+3^2} + \\frac{65}{1^2+8^2} + \\frac{65}{4^2+7^2}\\right) = 4 (13 + 5 + 1 + 1) = \\boxed{80}.\\]"
