    "problem": "Let\n\\[x^{12} - 1 = p_1(x) p_2(x) \\dotsm p_k(x),\\]where each non-constant polynomial $p_i(x)$ is monic with integer coefficients, and cannot be factored further over the integers.  Find $k.$",

    "solution": "First, we can apply difference of squares, to get\n\\[x^{12} - 1 = (x^6 - 1)(x^6 + 1).\\]We can apply difference of squares to $x^6 - 1$:\n\\[x^6 - 1 = (x^3 - 1)(x^3 + 1).\\]These factor by difference of cubes and sum of cubes:\n\\[(x^3 - 1)(x^3 + 1) = (x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1)(x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1).\\]Then by sum of cubes,\n\\[x^6 + 1 = (x^2 + 1)(x^4 - x^2 + 1).\\]Thus, the full factorization over the integers is\n\\[x^{12} - 1 = (x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1)(x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1)(x^2 + 1)(x^4 - x^2 + 1),\\]and there are $\\boxed{6}$ factors."
