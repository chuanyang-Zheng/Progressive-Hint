    "problem": "How many ordered triplets $(a,b,c)$ of rational numbers are there where $a,b,c$ are the roots of $x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c = 0?$",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Since $a,b,c$ are the roots of the cubic polynomial, Vieta's formulas give us:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n-(a+b+c) &= a \\tag{1}\\\\\nab+bc+ca &= b \\tag{2}\\\\\n-abc &= c\\tag{3}\n\\end{align*}Let's do this with casework.  Assume $c = 0.$  This satisfies equation (3).  Equation (1) translates to $2a + b = 0,$ and equation (2) translates to $ab = b.$  If $b = 0,$ then $a = 0.$  If $b \\neq 0,$ then $a = 1$ and $b = -2.$\n\nNow assume $c \\neq 0.$  Equation (3) then requires that\n\n\\begin{align*}\nab = -1. \\tag{4}\n\\end{align*}Equation (2) then becomes $-1 + c(a+b) = b.$\n\nLet $a + b = 0.$  Then (2) gives $b = -1, a = 1,$ and (1) then gives $c = -1.$  This is our third solution.\n\nIf $c \\neq 0$ and $a + b \\neq 0,$ then from the equation $-1 + c(a + b) = b$,\n\n$$c = \\frac{b+1}{a+b} = \\frac{a(b+1)}{a(a+b)}$$Using (4) to simplify:\n\n$$c = \\frac{-1 + a}{a^2 - 1} = \\frac{1}{a+1}$$Now (1) gives\n\n$$-\\left( a - \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{a+1} \\right) = a.$$Or $2a^3 + 2a^2 - 1 = 0.$  However, this has no rational roots (we can test $a = \\pm 1, \\pm 1/2$).  Therefore we have $\\boxed{3}$ solutions: $(0,0,0)$, $(1,-2,0)$, and $(1,-1,-1)$."
