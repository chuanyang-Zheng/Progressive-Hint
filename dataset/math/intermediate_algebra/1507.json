    "problem": "A sequence of positive integers with $a_1 = 1$ and $a_9+a_{10}=646$ is formed so that the first three terms are in geometric progression, the second, third, and fourth terms are in arithmetic progression, and, in general, for all $n\\ge1$, the terms $a_{2n-1}$, $a_{2n}$, and $a_{2n+1}$ are in geometric progression, and the terms $a_{2n}$, $a_{2n+1}$, and $a_{2n+2}$ are in arithmetic progression. Let $a_n$ be the greatest term in this sequence that is less than 1000.  Find $n+a_n$.",

    "solution": "Let $r = a_2.$  Then the first few terms are\n\\begin{align*}\na_1 &= 1, \\\\\na_2 &= r, \\\\\na_3 &= \\frac{a_2^2}{a_1} = r^2, \\\\\na_4 &= 2a_3 - a_2 = 2r^2 - r = r(2r - 1), \\\\\na_5 &= \\frac{a_4^2}{a_3} = \\frac{r^2 (2r - 1)^2}{r^2} = (2r - 1)^2, \\\\\na_6 &= 2a_5 - a_4 = (2r - 1)^2 - r(2r - 1) = (2r - 1)(3r - 2), \\\\\na_7 &= \\frac{a_6^2}{a_5} = \\frac{(2r - 1)^2 (3r - 2)^2}{(2r - 1)^2} = (3r - 2)^2, \\\\\na_8 &= 2a_7 - a_6 = 2(3r - 2)^2 - (2r - 1)(3r - 2) = (3r - 2)(4r - 3), \\\\\na_9 &= \\frac{a_8^2}{a_7} = \\frac{(3r - 2)^2 (4r - 3)^2}{(3r - 2)^2} = (4r - 3)^2, \\\\\na_{10} &= 2a_9 - a_8 = 2(4r - 3)^2 - (3r - 2)(4r - 3) = (4r - 3)(5r - 4).\n\\end{align*}and so on.\n\nMore generally, we can prove by induction that\n\\begin{align*}\na_{2k} &= [(k - 1)r - (k - 2)][kr - (k - 1)], \\\\\na_{2k + 1} &= [kr - (k - 1)]^2\n\\end{align*}for any positive integer $k.$\n\nThen $(4r - 3)^2 + (4r - 3)(5r - 4) = 646.$  This simplifies to $36r^2 - 55r - 625 = 0,$ which factors as $(r - 5)(36r + 125) = 0.$  Hence, $r = 5.$\n\nThen using the formulas above, we can compute that $a_{16} = 957$ and $a_{17} = 1089,$ so the final answer is $16 + 957 = \\boxed{973}.$"
