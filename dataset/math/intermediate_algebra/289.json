    "problem": "In a certain polynomial, all the coefficients are integers, and the constant coefficient is 42.  All the roots are integers, and distinct.  Find the largest possible number of integer roots.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "By the Integer Root Theorem, any integer root must be a factor of 42.  The prime factorization of 42 is $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7.$  Furthermore, the product of the roots is $(-1)^n \\cdot \\frac{42}{a_0},$ where $n$ is the degree of the polynomial, and $a_0$ is the leading coefficient.\n\nTo maximize the number of integer roots, which must be distinct, we can take the integer roots to be 2, 3, 7, 1, and $-1.$  This gives us a maximum of $\\boxed{5}$ integer roots."
