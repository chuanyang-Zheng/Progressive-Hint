    "solution": "Since $\\{a_n\\}$ is an arithmetic sequence, we may let $a_n = a + (n-1)d$ for some $a$ and $d.$ Since $\\{g_n\\}$ is a geometric sequence, we may let $g_n = cr^{n-1}$ for some $c$ and $r.$ Then we have \\[\\begin{aligned} a + c &= 0 \\\\ a + d + cr &= 0 \\\\ a + 2d + cr^2 &= 1 \\\\ a + 3d + cr^3 &= 0. \\end{aligned}\\]The first equation gives $c = -a,$ so the remaining equations become \\[\\begin{aligned} a + d - ar &= 0 \\\\ a + 2d - ar^2  &= 1 \\\\ a + 3d - ar^3  &=0. \\end{aligned}\\]From the equation $a+d-ar=0,$ we get $d=ar-a,$ and substituting in the remaining two equations gives \\[\\begin{aligned} -a + 2ar - ar^2 &= 1 \\\\ -2a + 3ar - ar^3 &= 0. \\end{aligned}\\]The equation $-2a + 3ar - ar^3 = 0$ factors as \\[a(r-1)^2(r+2) = 0.\\]Having $a=0$ would contradict the equation $-a+2ar-ar^2=1,$ so either $r=1$ or $r=-2.$ But if $r=1,$ then $\\{g_n\\}$ is a constant sequence, which means that $\\{a_n + g_n\\}$ is itself an arithmetic sequence; this is clearly impossible, because its first four terms are $0, 0, 1, 0.$ Thus, $r = -2.$ Then we have \\[-a + 2a(-2) - a(-2)^2 = 1,\\]or $-9a = 1,$ so $a = -\\frac{1}{9}.$ Then $c = -a = \\frac{1}{9}$ and $d = ar - a = -3a = \\frac{1}{3}.$ We conclude that \\[\\begin{aligned} a_n &= -\\frac19 + (n-1)\\frac13, \\\\ g_n &= \\frac19(-2)^n \\end{aligned}\\]for all $n.$ Then \\[a_{5} + g_{5} = -\\frac19 + 4 \\cdot \\frac13 + \\frac19 (-2)^{4} = \\boxed{3}.\\]"
