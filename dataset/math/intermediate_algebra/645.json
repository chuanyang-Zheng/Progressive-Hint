    "problem": "There is a unique polynomial $P(x)$ of degree $8$ with rational coefficients and leading coefficient $1,$ which has the number \\[\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{5}\\]as a root. Compute $P(1).$",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "To build $P(x),$ we start with the equation $x = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{5}$ and repeatedly rearrange and square the equation until all the terms have rational coefficients. First, we subtract $\\sqrt{5}$ from both sides, giving \\[x - \\sqrt{5} = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}.\\]Then, squaring both sides, we have \\[\\begin{aligned} (x-\\sqrt5)^2 &= 5 + 2\\sqrt{6} \\\\ x^2 - 2x\\sqrt{5} + 5 &= 5 + 2\\sqrt{6} \\\\ x^2 - 2x\\sqrt{5} &= 2\\sqrt{6}. \\end{aligned}\\]Adding $2x\\sqrt{5}$ to both sides and squaring again, we get \\[\\begin{aligned} x^2 &= 2x\\sqrt{5} + 2\\sqrt{6} \\\\ x^4 &= (2x\\sqrt{5} + 2\\sqrt{6})^2 \\\\ x^4 &= 20x^2 + 8x\\sqrt{30} + 24. \\end{aligned}\\]To eliminate the last square root, we isolate it and square once more: \\[\\begin{aligned} x^4 - 20x^2 - 24 &= 8x\\sqrt{30} \\\\ (x^4 - 20x^2-24)^2 &= 1920x^2. \\end{aligned}\\]Rewriting this equation as \\[(x^4-20x^2-24)^2 - 1920x^2 = 0,\\]we see that $P(x) = (x^4-20x^2-24)^2 - 1920x^2$ is the desired polynomial. Thus, \\[\\begin{aligned} P(1) &= (1-20-24)^2 - 1920 \\\\ &= 43^2 - 1920 \\\\ &= \\boxed{-71}. \\end{aligned}\\]"
