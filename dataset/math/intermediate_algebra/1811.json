    "problem": "In the sequence $2001$, $2002$, $2003$, $\\ldots$ , each term after the third is found by subtracting the previous term from the sum of the two terms that precede that term. For example, the fourth term is $2001 + 2002 - 2003 = 2000$. What is the $2004^\\textrm{th}$ term in this sequence?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the sequence be $(a_n),$ so $a_1 = 2001,$ $a_2 = 2002,$ and $a_3 = 2003,$ and\n\\[a_n = a_{n - 2} + a_{n - 3} - a_{n - 1}.\\]We can write this as\n\\[a_n - a_{n - 2} = a_{n - 3} - a_{n - 1} = -(a_{n - 1} - a_{n - 3}).\\]Let $b_n = a_n - a_{n - 2},$ so\n\\[b_n = -b_{n - 1}.\\]Also, $b_{n - 1} = -b_{n - 2},$ so $b_n = b_{n - 2}$.  Since $b_4 = 2000 - 2002 = -2,$ it follows that $b_n = -2$ for all even $n \\ge 4.$\n\nThen $a_n - a_{n - 2} = -2$ for all even $n \\ge 4.$  This means\n\\[a_2, a_4, a_6, a_8, \\dots\\]is an arithmetic sequence with common difference $-2.$  Hence, $a_{2004} = 2002 - 1001 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{0}.$"
