    "problem": "Two non-decreasing sequences of nonnegative integers have different first terms. Each sequence has the property that each term beginning with the third is the sum of the previous two terms, and the seventh term of each sequence is $N$. What is the smallest possible value of $N$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the two sequences be $a_1,$ $a_2,$ $a_3,$ $\\dots,$ and $b_1,$ $b_2,$ $b_3,$ $\\dots.$  Then\n\\begin{align*}\na_3 &= a_1 + a_2, \\\\\na_4 &= a_2 + a_3 = a_1 + 2a_2, \\\\\na_5 &= a_3 + a_4 = 2a_1 + 3a_2, \\\\\na_6 &= a_4 + a_5 = 3a_1 + 5a_2, \\\\\na_7 &= a_5 + a_6 = 5a_1 + 8a_2 = N.\n\\end{align*}Similarly, $N = b_7 = 5b_1 + 8b_2.$  Thus, $N = 5a_1 + 8a_2 = 5b_1 + 8b_2.$\n\nWithout loss of generality, assume that $a_1 < b_1.$  Then\n\\[5b_1 - 5a_1 = 8a_2 - 8b_2,\\]or $5(b_1 - a_1) = 8(a_2 - b_2).$  This implies $b_1 - a_1$ must be a positive multiple of 8, and $a_2 - b_2$ must be a positive multiple of 5.  Then $b_1 - a_1 \\ge 8$ and $a_2 - b_2 \\ge 5,$ so\n\\[a_2 \\ge b_2 + 5 \\ge b_1 + 5 \\ge a_1 + 13 \\ge 13.\\]Therefore, $N = 5a_1 + 8a_2 \\ge 8 \\cdot 13 = 104.$\n\nEquality occurs when $a_1 = 0,$ $a_2 = 13,$ and $b_1 = b_2 =8,$ so the smallest possible value of $N$ is $\\boxed{104}.$"
