    "problem": "Find the coordinates of either of the vertices of the hyperbola \\[16x^2+16x-4y^2-20y-85=0.\\](Enter your answer as an ordered pair. Enter the coordinates of one of the vertices, not both.)",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "To find the standard form for the equation of the hyperbola, we complete the square in both variables: \\[\\begin{aligned} 16(x^2+x) - 4(y^2+5y) - 85  &= 0 \\\\ 16(x^2+x+\\tfrac14)-4(y^2+5y+\\tfrac{25}4) - 85 &= 4 - 25 \\\\ 16(x+\\tfrac12)^2 - 4(y+\\tfrac52)^2 &= 64 \\\\ \\frac{(x+\\tfrac12)^2}{4} - \\frac{(y+\\tfrac52)^2}{16} &= 1. \\end{aligned}\\]Therefore, the center of the hyperbola is the point $\\left(-\\tfrac12, -\\tfrac52\\right).$ The vertices lie to the left and right of the center, and the distance from the center to each vertex is $\\sqrt{4} = 2.$ Thus, the vertices have coordinates \\[\\left(-\\tfrac12 \\pm 2,-\\tfrac52\\right) = \\boxed{\\left(\\tfrac32, -\\tfrac52\\right)} \\text{ and } \\boxed{\\left(-\\tfrac52, -\\tfrac52\\right)}.\\](Either point is a correct answer to this problem.)"
