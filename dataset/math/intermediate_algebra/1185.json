    "problem": "The graph of $x^2 - 2xy + 3y^2 = 5$ is an ellipse, although its axes are not parallel to the coordinate axes. Two horizontal lines and two vertical lines lie tangent to the ellipse, forming a rectangle, as shown:\n[asy]\nsize(7cm);\ndraw(rotate(20)*xscale(2.4)*unitcircle);\ndraw((-3.5,0)--(3.5,0),EndArrow);\ndraw((0,-2.5)--(0,2.5),EndArrow);\nreal r1=2.29; draw((r1,-2.2)--(r1,2.2),dotted);\ndraw((-r1,-2.2)--(-r1,2.2),dotted);\nreal r2=1.26; draw((-3,r2)--(3,r2),dotted);\ndraw((-3,-r2)--(3,-r2),dotted);\nlabel(\"$x$\",(3.5,0),E); label(\"$y$\",(0,2.5),N);\n[/asy]\nWhat is the area of the rectangle?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "The two vertical lines have equations of the form $x=m$ and $x=M,$ where $m$ and $M$ are the least and greatest possible $x-$coordinates for a point on the ellipse. Similarly, the horizontal lines have equations of the form $y=n$ and $y=N,$ where $n$ and $N$ are the least and greatest possible $y-$coordinates for a point on the ellipse. Therefore, we want to find the range of possible $x-$ and $y-$coordinates over all points on the ellipse.\n\nSubtracting $5$ from both sides, we can write the equation of the ellipse as a quadratic with $x$ as the variable: \\[x^2 - (2y)x + (3y^2-5) =0.\\]For a point $(x, y)$ to lie on the ellipse, this equation must have a real solution for $x.$ Therefore, the discriminant of the quadratic must be nonnegative: \\[(2y)^2 - 4(3y^2 - 5) \\ge 0,\\]or $-8y^2 + 20 \\ge 0.$ Solving for $y$ gives $-\\tfrac{\\sqrt{10}}2 \\le y \\le \\tfrac{\\sqrt{10}}2.$ Therefore, the equations of the two horizontal lines are $y = -\\tfrac{\\sqrt{10}}2$ and $y=\\tfrac{\\sqrt{10}}2.$\n\nWe can do the same, with the roles of the variables reversed, to find all possible values for $x.$ We write the equation of the ellipse as a quadratic in $y$, giving \\[3y^2 - (2x)y + (x^2-5) = 0.\\]The discriminant of this equation must be nonnegative, so we have \\[(2x)^2 - 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot (x^2-5) \\ge 0,\\]or $-8x^2 + 60 \\ge 0.$ Solving for $x$ gives $-\\tfrac{\\sqrt{30}}2 \\le x \\le \\tfrac{\\sqrt{30}}2.$ Therefore, the equations of the two vertical lines are $x=-\\tfrac{\\sqrt{30}}2$ and $x=\\tfrac{\\sqrt{30}}2.$\n\nIt follows that the side lengths of the rectangle are $2 \\cdot \\tfrac{\\sqrt{10}}2 = \\sqrt{10}$ and $2 \\cdot \\tfrac{\\sqrt{30}}2 = \\sqrt{30},$ so the area of the rectangle is \\[\\sqrt{10}\\cdot \\sqrt{30} = \\boxed{10\\sqrt3}.\\]"
