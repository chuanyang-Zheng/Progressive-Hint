    "solution": "First, we consider the cases where $z_0 = 1$ and $z_0 = -1.$  Note that\n\\[P(1) = 4 + a + b + c + d \\ge 4,\\]so $z = 1$ cannot be a root of $P(z).$\n\nIf $z = -1$ is a root of $P(z),$ then\n\\[P(-1) = 4 - a + b - c + d = (4 - a) + (b - c) + d = 0.\\]But $4 - a \\ge 0,$ $b - c \\ge 0,$ and $d \\ge 0,$ so we must have $a = 4,$ $b = c,$ and $d = 0.$  Conversely, if $a = 4,$ $b = c,$ and $d = 0,$ then\n\\[P(-1) = 4 - a + b - c + d = (4 - a) + (b - c) + d = 0,\\]so $z = -1$ is a root.  In this case,\n\\[P(1) = 4 + a + b + c + d = 4 + 4 + b + b = 8 + 2b.\\]The sum of all possible values of $P(1)$ are then\n\\[\\sum_{b = 0}^4 (8 + 2b) = 60.\\]Having exhausted the cases where $z_0 = 1$ or $z_0 = -1,$ we can then assume that $z_0$ is not real.  Let $z_0 = x_0 + iy_0,$ where $x_0$ and $y_0$ are real numbers, $y_0 \\neq 0.$  Since $|z_0| = 1,$ $x_0^2 + y_0^2 = 1.$  And since the coefficients of $P(z)$ are real, $x_0 - iy_0$ must also be a root, so\n\\[(z - x_0 - iy_0)(z - x_0 + iy_0) = z^2 - 2x_0z + x_0^2 + y_0^2 = z^2 - 2x_0 z + 1\\]must be a factor of $P(z).$  Then\n\\[P(z) = (z^2 - 2x_0 z + 1)(4z^2 + pz + d)\\]for some real number $p.$  Expanding, we get\n\\[P(z) = 4z^4 + (p - 8x_0) z^3 + (d - 2px_0 + 4) z^2 + (p - 8x_0) z + d.\\]Comparing coefficients, we get\n\\begin{align*}\np - 8x_0 &= a, \\\\\nd - 2px_0 + 4 &= b, \\\\\np - 2dx_0 &= c.\n\\end{align*}Subtracting the first and third equations, we get $2dx_0 - 8x_0 = a - c,$ so\n\\[2(d - 4) x_0 = a - c. \\quad (*)\\]If $d = 4,$ then $a = c.$  In fact, the chain $d \\le c \\le b \\le a \\le 4$ forces $a = b = c = d = 4,$ so\n\\[P(z) = 4z^4 + 4z^3 + 4z^2 + 4z + 4 = 4(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0.\\]If $z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0,$ then\n\\[(z - 1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0,\\]which becomes $z^5 - 1 = 0.$  Then $z^5 = 1,$ so $|z^5| = 1.$  Hence, $|z|^5 = 1,$ so $|z| = 1.$  This confirms that all the roots of $z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1$ have magnitude 1, and $P(1) = 20.$\n\nOtherwise, we can assume that $d \\neq 4.$  Then from equation $(*),$\n\\[2x_0 = \\frac{a - c}{d - 4}.\\]Multiplying the equation $p - 8x_0 = a$ by $d,$ we get\n\\[dp - 8dx_0 = ad.\\]Multiplying the equation $p - 2dx_0 = c$ by 4, we get\n\\[4p - 8dx_0 = 4c.\\]Subtracting these equations, we get $dp - 4p = ad - 4c,$ so\n\\[p = \\frac{ad - 4c}{d - 4}.\\]Let\n\\[k = 2px_0 = 2x_0 \\cdot p = \\frac{a - c}{d - 4} \\cdot \\frac{ad - 4c}{d - 4} = \\frac{(a - c)(ad - 4c)}{(d - 4)^2}.\\]Then from the equation $d - 2px_0 + 4 = b,$ $k = d - b + 4.$  Since $b \\le 4,$ $k \\ge 0.$  We then divide into the cases where $a = c$ and $a > c.$\n\nCase 1: $a=c$.\n\nIn this case, $k=0$ and $b=d+4$, so $a=b=c=4$ and $d=0$.  We have already covered these possibilities when we looked at the case where $z = -1$ was a root of $P(z).$\n\nCase 2: $a>c\\geq 0$.\n\nSince $k\\geq 0$, we have $ad-4c\\geq 0,$ or $ad \\ge 4c$.  However, $ad \\leq 4c$, so $ad = 4c$.  For this to hold, we must have $c = d.$  Then we obtain $k=0$ again. In this case, $b=d+4$, so $a=b=4$ and $c=d=0,$ and\n\\[P(z) = 4z^4 + 4z^3 + 4z^2 = 4z^2 (z^2 + z + 1).\\]The roots of $z^2 + z + 1 = 0$ are $z = -\\frac{1}{2} \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} i,$ which have magnitude 1, and $P(1) = 12.$\n\nTherefore, the desired sum is $60 + 20 + 12 = \\boxed{92}$."
