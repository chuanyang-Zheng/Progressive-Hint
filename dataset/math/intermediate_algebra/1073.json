    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "By the Rational Root Theorem, the only possible rational roots are of the form $\\frac{a}{b},$ where $a \\mid 15$ and $b \\mid 2.$  Checking all possibilities, we find that the rational roots are $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{2},-3}.$"
