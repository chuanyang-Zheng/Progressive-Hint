    "problem": "What is the maximum degree of a polynomial of the form $\\sum_{i=0}^n a_i x^{n-i}$ with $a_i = \\pm 1$ for $0 \\leq i \\leq n, 1 \\leq n$, such that all the zeros are real?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "The desired polynomials with $a_0 = -1$ are the negatives of those with $a_0 = 1,$ so consider $a_0 = 1.$  By Vieta's formulas, $-a_1$ is the sum of all the zeros, and $a_2$ is the sum of all possible pairwise products.  Therefore, the sum of the squares of the zeros of $x^n + a_1 x^{n-1} + \\dots + a_n$ is $a_1^2 - 2a_2.$  The product of the square of these zeros is $a_n^2.$\n\nLet the roots be $r_1$, $r_2$, $\\dots$, $r_n$, so\n\\[r_1^2 + r_2^2 + \\dots + r_n^2 = a_1^2 - 2a_2\\]and $r_1^2 r_2^2 \\dotsm r_n^2 = a_n^2$.\n\nIf all the zeros are real, then we can apply AM-GM to $r_1^2$, $r_2^2$, $\\dots$, $r_n^2$ (which are all non-negative), to get\n\n$$\\frac{a_1^2 - 2a_2}{n} \\geq (a_n^2)^{1/n},$$with equality only if the zeros are numerically equal.  We know that $a_i = \\pm 1$ for all $i$, so the right-hand side is equal to 1.  Also, $a_1^2 = 1$, so for the inequality to hold, $a_2$ must be equal to $-1$.  Hence, the inequality becomes $3/n \\ge 1$, so $n \\le 3$.  Now, we need to find an example of such a 3rd-order polynomial.\n\nThe polynomial $x^3 - x^2 - x + 1$ has the given form, and it factors as $(x - 1)^2 (x + 1)$, so all of its roots are real.  Hence, the maximum degree is $\\boxed{3}$."
