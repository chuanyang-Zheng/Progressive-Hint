    "problem": "When the polynomial $p(x)$ is divided by $x - 1,$ the remainder is 3.  When the polynomial $p(x)$ is divided by $x - 3,$ the remainder is 5.  What is the remainder when the polynomial $p(x)$ is divided by $(x - 1)(x - 3)$?",

    "solution": "By the Remainder Theorem, $p(1) = 3,$ and $p(3) = 5.$\n\nLet $q(x)$ and $ax + b$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when the polynomial $p(x)$ is divided by $(x - 1)(x - 3),$ so\n\\[p(x) = (x - 1)(x - 3) q(x) + ax + b.\\]Setting $x = 1,$ we get $p(1) = a + b,$ so $a + b = 3.$  Setting $x = 3,$ we get $p(3) = 3a + b,$ so $3a + b = 5.$  Solving, we find $a = 1$ and $b = 2.$\n\nTherefore, the remainder is $\\boxed{x + 2}.$"
