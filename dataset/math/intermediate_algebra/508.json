    "problem": "The polynomial\n$$g(x) = x^3-14x^2+18x+72$$has one integer root. What is it?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "By the Integer Root Theorem, any integer root must be a divisor of the constant term -- thus, in this case, a (positive or negative) divisor of $72$. However, this leaves quite a lot of candidates:\n$$\\pm 1,\\ \\pm 2,\\ \\pm 3,\\ \\pm 4,\\ \\pm 6,\\ \\pm 8,\\ \\pm 9,\\ \\pm 12,\\ \\pm 18,\\ \\pm 24,\\ \\pm 36,\\ \\pm 72.$$To narrow our choices, we define another polynomial.  Note that $g(1) = 77.$  Then by the Factor Theorem, $g(x) - 77$ is divisible by $x - 1.$  In other words,\n$$g(x) = (x-1)q(x) + 77$$for some polynomial $q(x)$. Thus if we define $h(x) = g(x+1)$, then we have\n$$h(x) = xq(x+1) + 77,$$so $h(x)$ has a constant term of $77$. Thus any integer root of $h(x)$ is a divisor of $77$; the possibilities are\n$$-77,\\ -11,\\ -7,\\ -1,\\ 1,\\ 7,\\ 11,\\ 77.$$This is useful because, if $x$ is a root of $g(x)$, then $h(x-1)=g(x)=0$, so $x-1$ must appear in the list of roots of $h(x)$. In particular, $x$ must be $1$ more than a root of $h(x)$, which gives the possibilities\n$$-76,\\ -10,\\ -6,\\ 0,\\ 2,\\ 8,\\ 12,\\ 78.$$Of these, only $-6$, $2$, $8$, and $12$ were candidates in our original list. Testing them one by one, we find that $x=\\boxed{12}$ is the only integer root of $g(x)$."
