    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Let\n\\[S = \\frac{c}{a} + \\frac{a}{b + c} + \\frac{b}{c}.\\]Then\n\\[S + 1 = \\frac{c}{a} + \\frac{a}{b + c} + \\frac{b}{c} + 1 = \\frac{c}{a} + \\frac{a}{b + c} + \\frac{b + c}{c}.\\]By AM-GM,\n\\begin{align*}\nS + 1 &= \\frac{c}{a} + \\frac{a}{b + c} + \\frac{b + c}{c} \\\\\n&\\ge 3 \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{c}{a} \\cdot \\frac{a}{b + c} \\cdot \\frac{b + c}{c}} \\\\\n&= 3.\n\\end{align*}Note that equality occurs if and only if\n\\[\\frac{c}{a} = \\frac{a}{b + c} = \\frac{b + c}{c} = 1.\\]Since $b$ and $c$ are positive,\n\\[\\frac{b + c}{c} > 1,\\]which tells us that equality cannot occur.  Therefore, $S + 1 > 3,$ which means $S > 2.$\n\nWe claim that $S$ can take on all real numbers that are greater than 2.  Let $c = a,$ so\n\\[S = 1 + \\frac{a}{b + a} + \\frac{b}{a}.\\]As $b$ approaches 0, this expression approaches 2.  This tells us that we can make this expression arbitrarily close to 2 as we want.\n\nOn the other hand, as $b$ becomes very large, the expression also becomes very large.  This tells us that can we can make this expression arbitrarily large.  Hence, by a continuity argument, $S$ can take on all values in $\\boxed{(2,\\infty)}.$"
