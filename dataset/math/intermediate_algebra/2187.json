    "solution": "The $y$-intercept is $(0,c).$  Since this is the point closest to $(12,3),$ the line joining $(0,c)$ and $(12,3)$ is perpendicular to the tangent to the parabola at $(0,c).$\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.5 cm);\n\nreal parab (real x) {\n  return(x^2 + 6*x + 5);\n}\n\ndraw(graph(parab,-6.5,0.5),red);\ndraw((-7,0)--(15,0));\ndraw((0,-5)--(0,10));\ndraw(((0,5) + (5)*(1/6,1))--((0,5) + (-8)*(1/6,1)),dashed);\ndraw((0,5)--(12,3));\n\ndot(\"$(12,3)$\", (12,3), E);\ndot(\"$(-5,0)$\", (-5,0), SW);\ndot(\"$(0,c)$\", (0,5), W);\n[/asy]\n\nThe equation of the tangent is of the form\n\\[y - c = mx\\]for some real number $m,$ so $y = mx + c.$  Substituting into $y = x^2 + bx + c,$ we get\n\\[mx + c = x^2 + bx + c,\\]so $x^2 + (b - m) x = 0.$  Since $y = mx + c$ is the equation of the tangent at $x = 0,$ this quadratic should have a double root of $x = 0,$ which means $m = b.$\n\nThus, the slope of the tangent is $b.$  The slope of the line joining $(0,c)$ and $(12,3)$ is $\\frac{3 - c}{12},$ so\n\\[b \\cdot \\frac{3 - c}{12} = -1.\\]Then $b = -\\frac{12}{3 - c} = \\frac{12}{c - 3}.$\n\nAlso, the parabola passes through $(-5,0),$ so\n\\[0 = 25 - 5b + c.\\]Substituting $b = \\frac{12}{c - 3},$ we get\n\\[25 - \\frac{60}{c - 3} + c = 0.\\]This simplifies to $c^2 + 22c - 135 = 0,$ which factors as $(c - 5)(c + 27) = 0.$  Hence, $c = 5$ or $c = -27.$\n\nIf $c = -27,$ then $b = -\\frac{2}{5},$ which does not satisfy the given conditions.  Therefore, $c = 5,$ and $b = 6,$ so $(b,c) = \\boxed{(6,5)}.$"
