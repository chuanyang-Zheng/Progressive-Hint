    "solution": "Let $z = a + bi$ and $w = c + di.$  We want $zw = 1.$  Then $|zw| = |z||w| = 1,$ so $|z|^2 |w|^2 = 1.$  Hence,\n\\[(a^2 + b^2)(c^2 + d^2) = 1.\\]If both $a = b = 0,$ then $z = 0,$ so $zw = 0.$  Hence, $a^2 + b^2 \\ge 1.$  Similarly, we can show that $c^2 + d^2 \\ge 1.$  Then\n\\[(a^2 + b^2)(c^2 + d^2) \\ge 1.\\]But $(a^2 + b^2)(c^2 + d^2) = 1,$ and the only way to get equality is if $a^2 + b^2 = c^2 + d^2 = 1.$\n\nIf $a^2 + b^2 = 1,$ then one of $a,$ $b$ must be 0 and the other must be $\\pm 1.$  Thus, $z$ can only be 1, $-1,$ $i,$ or $-i.$  It is easy to check that all $\\boxed{4}$ complex numbers are units."
