    "problem": "If $x$ is a real number and $\\lfloor x \\rfloor = -9,$ how many possible values are there for $\\lfloor 5x \\rfloor$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "We get that $-9 \\le x < -8,$ so multiplying by $5$ gives $-45 \\le 5x < -40.$ Hence, the possible values for $\\lfloor 5x \\rfloor$ are $-45, -44, -43, -42, -41,$ of which there are $\\boxed{5}.$"
