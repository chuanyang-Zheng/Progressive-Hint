    "solution": "The $n$th term of $\\Delta(\\Delta A)$ is $(a_{n+2} - a_{n+1}) - (a_{n+1} - a_n) = a_{n+2} - 2a_{n+1} + a_n,$ so we have $a_{n+2} - 2a_{n+1} + a_n = 1$ for all $n.$\n\nFor a particular $k,$ summing up the equations \\[\\begin{aligned} {a_3}-2a_2+a_1&=1\\\\ a_4-{2a_3}+a_2&=1\\\\ a_5 - 2a_4 + {a_3} &= 1 \\\\ &\\;\\vdots\\\\ {a_{k-1}} - 2a_{k-2} + a_{k-3} &= 1 \\\\ a_k- {2a_{k-1}} + a_{k-2}  &=1\\\\ a_{k+1} - 2a_k + {a_{k-1}} &= 1\\\\ \\end{aligned}\\]gives \\[a_{k+1} - a_k - a_2 + a_1 = k-1\\](with cancellation along the diagonals). Writing this equation down from $k=1$ to $k=m-1,$ we get \\[\\begin{aligned} a_2 - a_1 - a_2 + a_1 &= 0\\\\ a_3 - a_2 - a_2 + a_1 &= 1 \\\\ & \\; \\vdots \\\\ a_{m} - a_{m-1} -  a_2 + a_1 &= m-2 \\end{aligned}\\]Summing these up then gives \\[\\begin{aligned} a_{m} - a_1 - (m-1)(a_2 - a_1) &= 0 + 1 + 2 + \\dots + (m-2) \\\\ &= \\tfrac12(m-2)(m-1). \\end{aligned}\\]That is, $a_m = \\tfrac12(m-2)(m-1) + a_1 + m(a_2-a_1),$ which is of the form \\[a_m = \\tfrac{1}{2} m^2 + Bm + C,\\]where $B$ and $C$ are constants.\n\nWe are given that $a_{19} = a_{92} = 0,$ which means that $\\tfrac{1}{2}m^2 + Bm + C$ has roots $19$ and $92.$ Therefore it must be the case that \\[a_m = \\tfrac{1}{2}(m-19)(m-92)\\]for all $m.$ Thus, \\[a_1 = \\tfrac{1}{2}(1-19)(1-92) = \\tfrac{1}{2} (-18)  (-91) = \\boxed{819}.\\]"
