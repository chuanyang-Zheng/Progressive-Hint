    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "We claim that such an $r$ exists if and only if \\[\\frac{3n^2}{1000} + \\frac{3n}{1000^2} + \\frac1{1000^3} > 1.\\]First, suppose that $(n+r)^3$ is an integer, for some $r \\in \\left(0, \\tfrac{1}{1000}\\right).$ Since $(n+r)^3>n^3$ and $n^3$ is an integer, we must have \\[(n+r)^3 \\ge n^3 + 1,\\]so $3rn^2 + 3nr^2 + r^3 \\ge 1.$ Since $r < \\tfrac{1}{1000}$ and $n>0$, we get $\\tfrac{3n^2}{1000} + \\tfrac{3n}{1000^2} + \\tfrac{1}{10^3} > 3rn^2 + 3nr^2 + r^3 \\ge 1,$ as desired.\n\nConversely, suppose that $\\tfrac{3n^2}{1000} + \\tfrac{3n}{1000^2} + \\tfrac{1}{10^3} > 1.$ Define $f(x) = 3xn^2 + 3nx^2 + x^3$, so that we have $f\\left(\\tfrac{1}{1000}\\right) > 1.$ Since $f(0) = 0 < 1$ and $f$ is continuous, there must exist $r \\in \\left(0, \\tfrac1{1000}\\right)$ such that $f(r) = 1.$ Then for this value of $r$, we have \\[\\begin{aligned} (n+r)^3 &= n^3 + 3rn^2 + 3nr^2 + r^3 \\\\&= n^3 + f(r)\\\\& = n^3 + 1, \\end{aligned}\\]which is an integer, as desired.\n\nThus, it suffices to find the smallest positive integer $n$ satisfying \\[\\frac{3n^2}{1000} + \\frac{3n}{1000^2} + \\frac{1}{1000^3} > 1.\\]The first term on the left-hand side is much larger than the other two terms, so we look for $n$ satisfying $\\tfrac{3n^2}{1000} \\approx 1$, or $n \\approx \\sqrt{\\tfrac{1000}{3}} \\approx 18$. We find that $n = 18$ does not satisfy the inequality, but $n = \\boxed{19}$ does."
