    "problem": "Which type of conic section is described by the equation \\[x^2 = 2x + 2y - 3?\\]Enter \"C\" for circle, \"P\" for parabola, \"E\" for ellipse, \"H\" for hyperbola, and \"N\" for none of the above.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Because only one of the variables appears squared (that is, there is an $x^2$ term but no $y^2$ term), this conic section must be a $\\boxed{\\text{(P)}}$ parabola."
