    "problem": "Three noncollinear points and a line $\\ell$ are given in the plane. Suppose no two of the points lie on a line parallel to $\\ell$ (or $\\ell$ itself). There are exactly $n$ lines $m$ perpendicular to $\\ell$ with the following property: the three circles with centers at the given points and tangent to line $m$ all concur at some point. Find all possible values of $n$.\n\nEnter all possible values of $n,$ separated by commas.",

    "solution": "The condition for line $m$ is that each of the three points lies at an equal distance from the line as from some fixed point; in other words, the line is the directrix of a parabola containing the three points, and the fixed point is the focus.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize (1 cm);\n\nreal func (real x) {\n  return(x^2/4);\n}\n\nreal a, b, c;\npair A, B, C, F;\n\na = -2; b = 1.5; c = 3;\nA = (a,func(a));\nB = (b,func(b));\nC = (c,func(c));\nF = (0,1);\n\ndraw(graph(func,-4,5),red);\ndraw(Circle(A,abs(A - F)));\ndraw(Circle(B,abs(B - F)));\ndraw(Circle(C,abs(C - F)));\ndraw((-4,-1)--(6,-1));\ndraw(A--F,dashed);\ndraw(B--F,dashed);\ndraw(C--F,dashed);\ndraw(A--(a,-1),dashed);\ndraw(B--(b,-1),dashed);\ndraw(C--(c,-1),dashed);\ndraw((-3,-2)--(-3,5.5));\n\nlabel(\"$m$\", (6,-1), E);\nlabel(\"$\\ell$\", (-3,5.5), N);\n\ndot(A);\ndot(B);\ndot(C);\n[/asy]\n\nThree noncollinear points in the coordinate plane determine a quadratic polynomial in $x$ unless two of the points have the same $x$-coordinate. Therefore, given the direction of the directrix, three noncollinear points determine a parabola, unless two of the points lie on a line perpendicular to the directrix. This case is ruled out by the given condition, so the answer is $\\boxed{1}$."
