    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Using the Remainder Theorem, we know that the remainder when $f(x) = kx^4+9x^3+kx^2+32x-11$ is divided by $x + 5$ is\n$$f(-5) = k(625)+9(-125)+k(25)+32(-5)-11 = 650k -1296.$$So we have the remainder\n$$650k - 1296 = 4$$Solving for $k$ gives us $k = \\boxed{2}$."
