    "solution": "By the Trivial Inequality, $(x - y)^2 \\ge 0$ for all real numbers $x$ and $y.$  We can re-arrange this as\n\\[x^2 + y^2 \\ge 2xy.\\]Equality occurs if and only if $x = y.$  (This looks like AM-GM, but we need to establish it for all real numbers, not just nonnegative numbers.)\n\nSetting $x = a^2$ and $y = b^2,$ we get\n\\[a^4 + b^4 \\ge 2a^2 b^2.\\]Setting $x = c^2$ and $y = d^2,$ we get\n\\[c^4 + d^4 \\ge 2c^2 d^2.\\]Setting $x = ab$ and $y = cd,$ we get\n\\[a^2 b^2 + c^2 d^2 \\ge 2abcd.\\]Therefore\n\\[a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4 \\ge 2a^2 b^2 + 2c^2 d^2 = 2(a^2 b^2 + c^2 d^2) \\ge 4abcd.\\]Since $a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4 = 48$ and $4abcd = 48,$ all the inequalities above become equalities.\n\nThe only way this can occur is if $a^2 = b^2,$ $c^2 = d^2,$ and $ab = cd.$  From the equations $a^2 = b^2$ and $c^2 = d^2,$ $|a| = |b|$ and $|c| = |d|.$  From the equation $ab = cd,$ $|ab| = |cd|,$ so $|a|^2 = |c|^2,$ which implies $|a| = |c|.$  Therefore,\n\\[|a| = |b| = |c| = |d|.\\]Since $abcd = 12,$\n\\[|a| = |b| = |c| = |d| = \\sqrt[4]{12}.\\]There are 2 ways to choose the sign of $a,$ 2 ways to choose the sign of $b,$ and 2 ways to choose the sign of $c.$  Then there is only 1 way to choose sign of $d$ so that $abcd = 12.$  (And if $|a| = |b| = |c| = |d| = \\sqrt[4]{12},$ then $a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4 = 48.$)  Hence, there are a total of $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{8}$ solutions."
