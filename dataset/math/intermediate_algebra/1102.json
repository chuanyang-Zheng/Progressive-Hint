    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "By the Integer Root Theorem, the possible integer roots are all the divisors of 14 (including negative divisors), which are $-14,$ $-7,$ $-2,$ $-1,$ $1,$ $2,$ $7,$ and $14.$  Checking, we find that the only integer roots are $\\boxed{-2,1}.$"
