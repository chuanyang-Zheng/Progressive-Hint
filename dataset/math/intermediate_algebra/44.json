    "solution": "If we write the value of $f(m,n)$ at the point $(m,n)$ in the plane and border the resulting array with zeros as in the diagram,\n\n$\\begin{matrix}0 &    &    &    &    &   &  \\\\0 & 1  &    &    &    &   &  \\\\0 & 1- & 7  &    &    &   &  \\\\0 & 1| & 5- & 13 &    &   &  \\\\0 & 1  & 3| & 5- & 7  & 9 &  \\\\0 & 1  & 1  & 1| & 1- & 1 &  \\\\0 & 0  & 0  & 0  & 0  & 0 & 0\\\\\\end{matrix}$\n\nNumbers with a $|$ appended belong to $S_2$; numbers with a $-$ appended belong to $S_3$.\n\nwe see that the recursion relation together with the given values for $f(1,n)$ and $f(m,1)$ amount to the assertion that every non-zero entry in this array (except $f(1,1)$) is the sum of the entry immediately to its left, the entry just below it, and the entry diagonally below it to the left.\n\nNow $S(k+2)$  is the sum of the terms on the $(k+2)$nd diagonal, $x+y=k+2,$ and it is clear from the diagram that each non-zero term on the $(k+1)$st diagonal enters this sum twice while each term on the $k$th diagonal enters once; hence, $S(k+2) = 2S(k+1) + S(k).$\n\nThis expression can be verified as follows:\n\n$$S(k+2) = \\sum_{j=1}^{k+1} f(k+2-j,j)$$This is the diagonal running from $(k+1,1)$ to $(1,k+1).$  We would like to apply the recursion relation, but it does not apply for $f(k+1,1)$ or $f(1,k+1),$ so we detach them from the sum and then expand $f(k+2-j,j)$ using the recursion relation:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nS(k+2) &= f(k+1,1) + f(1,k+1) + \\sum_{j=2}^k f(k+2-j,j) \\\\\n  &= f(k+1,1) + f(1,k+1) \\\\\n  &+ \\sum_{j=2}^k [ f(k+1-j,j) + f(k+2-j,j-1) + f(k+1-j,j-1) ]\n\\end{align*}The sum of $f(k+1-j,j-1)$ is the diagonal corresponding to $S(k).$  The other two sums correspond to most of the diagonal pertaining to $S(k+1),$ though each one is missing one of its boundary value 1 terms.  Setting $j = \\ell+1$ in two of the sums and use the facts that $f(k+1,1) = 1 = f(k,1)$ and $f(1,k+1) = 1 = f(1,k),$ we have\n\n\\begin{align*}\nS(k+2) &= \\left[ f(k,1) + \\sum_{j=2}^k f(k+1-j,j) \\right] + \\left[ \\sum_{\\ell=1}^{k-1} f(k+1-\\ell,\\ell) + f(1,k) \\right] + \\sum_{\\ell=1}^{k-1} f(k-\\ell,\\ell) \\\\\n  &= S(k+1) + S(k+1) + S(k)\n\\end{align*}So $S(k+2) = 2S(k+1) + S(k),$ or $p = 2, q = 1$ so $pq = \\boxed{2}.$"
