    "problem": "What is the value of the following expression: $1 - 3 + 5 - 7 + 9 - \\cdots - 43 + 45 - 47 + 49$ ?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Pair every two terms starting from the first. We see that the sum of each pair is $-2$. There are $(45+3)/4=12$ pairs, so the sum of all the pairs is $-2\\cdot12=-24$. Add that to the last number in the series and the value of the entire expression is $-24+49=\\boxed{25}$."
