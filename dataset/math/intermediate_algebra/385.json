    "problem": "For how many ordered triples $(x,y,z)$ of nonnegative integers less than $20$ are there exactly two distinct elements in the set $\\{i^x, (1+i)^y, z\\}$, where $i^2 = -1$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "We divide into cases.\n\nCase 1: $i^x = (1 + i)^y \\neq z.$\n\nNote that $|i^x| = |i|^x = 1$ and $|(1 + i)^y| = |1 + i|^y = (\\sqrt{2})^y,$ so we must have $y = 0.$  Then $i^x = 1$ only when $x$ is a multiple of 4.  There are 5 possible values of $x$ (0, 4, 8, 12, 16), and 19 possible values of $z,$ so there are $5 \\cdot 19 = 95$ triples in this case.\n\nCase 2: $i^x = z \\neq (1 + i)^y.$\n\nThe only way that $i^x$ can be a nonnegative integer is if it is equal to 1, which in turn means that $x$ is a multiple of 4.  As in case 1, $|(1 + i)^y| = (\\sqrt{2})^y,$ so $(1 + i)^y \\neq 1$ is satisfied as long as $y \\neq 0.$  This gives us 5 possible values of $x,$ and 19 possible values of $y,$ so there are $5 \\cdot 19 = 95$ triples in this case.\n\nCase 3: $(1 + i)^y = z \\neq i^x.$\n\nNote that $(1 + i)^2 = 2i,$ and we must raise $2i$ to a fourth power to get a nonnegative integer.  Hence, $(1 + i)^y$ is a nonnegative integer only when $y$ is a multiple if 8.  Furthermore, $(1 + i)^8 = (2i)^4 = 16,$ and $(1 + i)^{16} = 16^2 = 256,$ so the only possible values of $y$ are 0 and 8.\n\nFor $y = 0,$ $z = 1,$ and then $x$ cannot be a multiple of 4.  This gives us $20 - 5 = 15$ triples.\n\nFor $y = 8,$ $z = 16,$ and $x$ can take on any value.  This gives us 20 triples, so there are $15 + 20 = 35$ triples in this case.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of $95 + 95 + 35 = \\boxed{225}$ triples."
