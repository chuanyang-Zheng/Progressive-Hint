    "solution": "First, we claim that any quartic with real coefficients can be written as the product of two quadratic polynomials with real coefficients.\n\nLet $z$ be a complex root of the quartic.  If $z$ is not real, then its complex conjugate $\\overline{z}$ is also a root.  Then the quadratic $(x - z)(x - \\overline{z})$ has real coefficients, and when we factor out this quadratic, we are left with a quadratic that also has real coefficients.\n\nIf $z$ is real, then we can factor out $x - z,$ leaving us with a cubic with real coefficients.  Every cubic with real coefficients has at least one real roots, say $w.$  Then we can factor out $x - w,$ leaving us with a quadratic with real coefficients.  The product of this quadratic and $(x - z)(x - w)$ is the original quartic.\n\nSo, let\n\\[x^4 + ax^3 + 3x^2 + bx + 1 = (x^2 + px + r) \\left( x^2 + qx + \\frac{1}{r} \\right), \\quad (*)\\]where $p,$ $q,$ and $r$ are real.\n\nSuppose one quadratic factor has distinct real roots, say $z$ and $w.$  Then the only way that the quartic can be nonnegative for all real numbers $x$ is if the roots of the other quadratic are also $z$ and $w.$  Thus, we can write the quadratic as\n\\[(x - z)^2 (x - w)^2.\\]Thus, we can assume that for each quadratic factor, the quadratic does not have real, distinct roots.  This implies that the discriminant of each quadratic is at most 0.  Thus,\n\\[p^2 \\le 4r \\quad \\text{and} \\quad q^2 \\le \\frac{4}{r}.\\]It follows that $r > 0.$  Multiplying these inequalities, we get\n\\[p^2 q^2 \\le 16,\\]so $|pq| \\le 4.$\n\nExpanding $(*)$ and matching coefficients, we get\n\\begin{align*}\np + q &= a, \\\\\npq + r + \\frac{1}{r} &= 3, \\\\\n\\frac{p}{r} + qr &= b.\n\\end{align*}Therefore,\n\\begin{align*}\na^2 + b^2 &= (p + q)^2 + \\left( \\frac{p}{r} + qr \\right)^2 \\\\\n&= p^2 + 2pq + q^2 + \\frac{p^2}{r^2} + 2pq + q^2 r^2 \\\\\n&= p^2 + 4pq + q^2 + \\frac{p^2}{r^2} + q^2 r^2 \\\\\n&\\le 4r + 4pq + \\frac{4}{r} + \\frac{4r}{r^2} + \\frac{4}{r} \\cdot r^2 \\\\\n&= 4pq + 8r + \\frac{8}{r}.\n\\end{align*}From the equation $pq + r + \\frac{1}{r} = 3,$\n\\[r + \\frac{1}{r} = 3 - pq,\\]so\n\\[a^2 + b^2 \\le 4pq + 8(3 - pq) = 24 - 4pq \\le 40.\\]To obtain equality, we must have $pq = -4$ and $r + \\frac{1}{r} = 7.$  This leads to $r^2 - 7r + 1 = 0,$ whose roots are real and positive.  For either root $r,$ we can set $p = \\sqrt{4r}$ and $q = -\\sqrt{\\frac{4}{r}},$ which shows that equality is possible.  For example, we can obtain the quartic\n\\[\\left( x - \\frac{3 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\right)^2 \\left( x + \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\right)^2 = x^4 - 2x^3 \\sqrt{5} + 3x^2 + 2x \\sqrt{5} + 1.\\]Hence, the maximum value of $a^2 + b^2$ is $\\boxed{40}.$"
