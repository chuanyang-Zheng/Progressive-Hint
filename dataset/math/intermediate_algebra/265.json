    "problem": "How many integers $x$ satisfy $|x|+5<7$ and $|x-3|>2$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "The inequality $|x| + 5 < 7$ reduces to $|x| < 2,$ and the only integers that satisfy this inequality are $-1,$ 0, and 1.  Of these, the only integers that satisfy $|x - 3| > 2$ are 0 and $-1,$ so there are $\\boxed{2}$ such integers."
