    "problem": "In the coordinate plane, the graph of\n\\[|x + y - 1| + \\Big| |x| - x \\Big| + \\Big| |x - 1| + x - 1 \\Big| = 0\\]is a certain curve.  Find the length of this curve.",
    "level": "Level 4",

    "solution": "The only way that the sum of absolute terms can be 0 is if each absolute value term is equal to 0.  Thus,\n\\begin{align*}\n|x + y - 1| &= 0, \\\\\n\\Big| |x| - x \\Big| &= 0, \\\\\n\\Big| |x - 1| + x - 1 \\Big| &= 0.\n\\end{align*}From the second equation, $|x| - x = 0,$ or $|x| = x.$  Thus, $x$ must satisfy $x \\ge 0.$\n\nFrom the third equation, $|x - 1| + x - 1 = 0,$ or $|x - 1| = 1 - x.$  Thus, $x$ must satisfy $1 - x \\ge 0,$ or $x \\le 1.$\n\nFinally, from the first equation, $x + y = 1.$  Thus, the graph is the line segment joining $(0,1)$ and $(1,0)$.  The length of this line segment is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{2}}.$"
