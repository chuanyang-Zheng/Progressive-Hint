    "problem": "Let $F_1$ and $F_2$ be the foci of the ellipse $kx^2 + y^2 = 1,$ where $k > 1$ is a constant. Suppose that there is a circle which passes through $F_1$ and $F_2$ and which lies tangent to the ellipse at two points on the $x$-axis. Compute $k.$",

    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Writing the equation of the ellipse in the form \\[\\frac{x^2}{(1/\\sqrt k)^2} + \\frac{y^2}{1^2} = 1,\\]we see that the lengths of the semi-horizontal and semi-vertical axis are $\\tfrac{1}{\\sqrt{k}}$ and $1,$ respectively. Since $k > 1,$ the vertical axis is the longer (major) axis. Then the distance from the center of the ellipse, the origin, to each focus is \\[\\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{k}}\\right)^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{k-1}}{\\sqrt{k}}.\\][asy]\nsize(7cm);\ndraw((0,-1.4)--(0,1.4),EndArrow); label(\"$y$\",(0,1.4),N);\ndraw((-1.2,0)--(1.2,0),EndArrow); label(\"$x$\",(1.2,0),E);\ndraw(xscale(1/sqrt(2))*unitcircle);\ndraw(scale(1/sqrt(2),1/sqrt(2))*unitcircle);\ndot(\"$F_1$\",(0,1/sqrt(2)),NW);\ndot(\"$F_2$\",(0,-1/sqrt(2)),SW);\n[/asy] The existence of such a circle implies that the origin is equidistant from each focus and each endpoint of the horizontal (minor) axis. Therefore, we have \\[\\frac{\\sqrt{k-1}}{\\sqrt{k}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}},\\]so $\\sqrt{k-1} = 1.$ Thus, $k-1=1,$ and $k=\\boxed{2}.$"
