    "solution": "Evidently $x^2$ must be an integer. Well, there aren't that many things to check, are there? Among positive $x$, $\\sqrt 8$ is too small and $\\sqrt 9$ is too big; among negative $x$, $-\\sqrt{15}$ is too small and $-\\sqrt{13}$ is too big. The only solution is $\\boxed{-\\sqrt{14}}$."
