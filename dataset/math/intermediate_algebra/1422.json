    "problem": "A polynomial with integer coefficients is of the form\n\\[2x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + 1 = 0.\\]Find the number of different possible rational roots of this polynomial.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "By the Rational Root Theorem, the only possible rational roots are of the form $\\pm \\frac{a}{b},$ where $a$ divides 1 and $b$ divides 2.  Thus, the possible rational roots are\n\\[\\pm 1, \\ \\pm \\frac{1}{2}.\\]Thus, there are $\\boxed{4}$ possible rational roots."
