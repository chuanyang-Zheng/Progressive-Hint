    "problem": "What is the distance in the complex plane between $5+6i$ and $-2+2i$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "The distance between two points in the complex plane is the magnitude of their difference. Therefore our distance is $|(5+6i)-(-2+2i)|=|7+4i|=\\boxed{\\sqrt{65}}$."
