    "problem": "Suppose the polynomial\n$$f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$$has integer coefficients, and its roots are distinct integers.\n\nGiven that $a_n=2$ and $a_0=66$, what is the least possible value of $|a_{n-1}|$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Since $f(x)$ has integer coefficients, the Integer Root Theorem tells us that all integer roots of $f(x)$ must divide the constant term $66=2\\cdot 3\\cdot 11$. Thus, the possible integer roots of $f(x)$ are\n$$\\pm 1,~\\pm 2,~\\pm 3,~\\pm 6,~\\pm 11,~\\pm 22,~\\pm 33,~\\pm 66.$$Moreover, since we know that all roots of $f(x)$ are integers, we know that all roots of $f(x)$ appear in the list above.\n\nNow we apply Vieta's formulas. The product of the roots of $f(x)$ is $(-1)^n\\cdot\\frac{a_0}{a_n}$, which is $33$ or $-33$. Also, the sum of the roots is $-\\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n}=-\\frac{a_{n-1}}2$. Thus, in order to minimize $|a_{n-1}|$, we should make the absolute value of the sum of the roots as small as possible, working under the constraint that the product of the roots must be $33$ or $-33$.\n\nWe now consider two cases.\n\nCase 1 is that one of $33,-33$ is a root, in which case the only other possible roots are $\\pm 1$. In this case, the absolute value of the sum of the roots is at least $32$.\n\nThe alternative, Case 2, is that one of $11,-11$ is a root and one of $3,-3$ is a root. Again, the only other possible roots are $\\pm 1$, so the absolute value of the sum of the roots is at least $11-3-1=7$, which is better than the result of Case 1. If the absolute value of the sum of the roots is $7$, then $|a_{n-1}|=7|a_n|=7\\cdot 2=14$.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that $|a_{n-1}|\\ge 14$, and we can check that equality is achieved by\n\\begin{align*}\nf(x) &= 2(x+11)(x-3)(x-1) \\\\\n&= 2x^3+14x^2-82x+66,\n\\end{align*}which has integer coefficients and integer roots. So the least possible value of $|a_{n-1}|$ is $\\boxed{14}$."
