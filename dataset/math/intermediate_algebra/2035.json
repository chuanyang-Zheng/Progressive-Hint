    "solution": "Note that if $r$ is a root, then so is $-r,$ so the roots are of the form $p,$ $-p,$ $q,$ $-q,$ for some complex numbers $p$ and $q.$  Since there are only two distinct roots, at least two of these values must be equal.\n\nIf $p = -p,$ then $p = 0$ is a root.  Hence, setting $x = 0,$ we must get 0.  In other words, $a^3 = 0,$ so $a = 0.$  But then the polynomial is\n\\[x^4 - x^2 = x^2 (x - 1)(x + 1) = 0,\\]so there are three roots.  Hence, there are no solutions in this case.\n\nOtherwise, $p = \\pm q,$ so the roots are of the form $p,$ $p,$ $-p,$ $-p,$ and the quartic is\n\\[(x - p)^2 (x + p)^2 = x^4 - 2p^2 x^2 + p^4.\\]Matching coefficients, we get $-2p^2 = a^2 - 1$ and $p^4 = a^3.$  Then $p^2 = \\frac{1 - a^2}{2},$ so\n\\[\\left( \\frac{1 - a^2}{2} \\right)^2 = a^3.\\]This simplifies to $a^4 - 4a^3 - 2a^2 + 1 = 0.$\n\nLet $f(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 - 2x^2 + 1.$  Since $f(0.51) > 0$ and $f(0.52) < 0,$ there is one root in the interval $(0.51,0.52).$  Since $f(4.43) < 0$ and $f(4.44) > 0,$ there is another root in the interval $(4.43,4.44).$  Factoring out these roots, we are left with a quadratic whose coefficients are approximately\n\\[x^2 + 0.95x + 0.44 = 0.\\]The discriminant is negative, so this quadratic has two distinct, nonreal complex roots.  Therefore, all the roots of $a^4 - 4a^3 - 2a^2 + 1 = 0$ are distinct, and by Vieta's formulas, their sum is $\\boxed{4}.$"
