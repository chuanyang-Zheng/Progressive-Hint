    "problem": "During the weekends, Eli delivers milk in the complex plane. On Saturday, he begins at $z$ and delivers milk to houses located at $z^3,z^5,z^7,\\ldots,z^{2013}$ in that order; on Sunday, he begins at $1$ and delivers milk to houses located at $z^2,z^4,z^6,\\ldots,z^{2012}$ in that order.  Eli always walks directly (in a straight line) between two houses. If the distance he must travel from his starting point to the last house is $\\sqrt{2012}$ on both days, find the real part of $z^2$.",

    "solution": "The sum of the Saturday distances is\n\\[|z^3 - z| + |z^5 - z^3| + \\dots + |z^{2013} - z^{2011}| = \\sqrt{2012}.\\]The sum of the Sunday distances is\n\\[|z^2 - 1| + |z^4 - z^2| + \\dots + |z^{2012} - z^{2010}| = \\sqrt{2012}.\\]Note that\n\\[|z^3 - z| + |z^5 - z^3| + \\dots + |z^{2013} - z^{2011}| = |z| (|z^2 - 1| + |z^4 - z^2| + \\dots + |z^{2012} - z^{2010}|),\\]so $|z| = 1.$\n\nThen\n\\begin{align*}\n|z^2 - 1| + |z^4 - z^2| + \\dots + |z^{2012} - z^{2010}| &= |z^2 - 1| + |z^2| |z^2 - 1| + \\dots + |z^{2010}| |z^2 - 1| \\\\\n&= |z^2 - 1| + |z|^2 |z^2 - 1| + \\dots + |z|^{2010} |z^2 - 1| \\\\\n&= 1006 |z^2 - 1|,\n\\end{align*}so\n\\[|z^2 - 1| = \\frac{\\sqrt{2012}}{1006}.\\]We have that $|z^2| = |z|^2 = 1.$  Let $z^2 = a + bi,$ where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, so $a^2 + b^2 = 1.$  From the equation $|z^2 - 1| = \\frac{\\sqrt{2012}}{1006},$\n\\[(a - 1)^2 + b^2 = \\frac{2012}{1006^2} = \\frac{1}{503}.\\]Subtracting these equations, we get\n\\[2a - 1 = 1 - \\frac{1}{503} = \\frac{502}{503},\\]so $a = \\boxed{\\frac{1005}{1006}}.$"
