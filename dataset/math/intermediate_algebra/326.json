    "problem": "Matt and Marie are choosing numbers on the complex plane. Matt chooses the point $1-4i$. Marie chooses $-4+2i$. How far apart are Marie and Matt's points?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "To find the distance between two complex numbers, we find the magnitude of their difference. We calculate $(1-4i)-(-4+2i)$ to be $5-6i$. Now, $|5-6i|=\\sqrt{5^2+6^2}=\\sqrt{61}$, thus the distance between the points is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{61}}$."
