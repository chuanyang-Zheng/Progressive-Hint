    "problem": "Compute the length of the major axis of the ellipse \\[x^2 + 2y^2 + 6x + 8y = 15.\\]",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "To put this equation in standard form, we complete the square in each variable: \\[\\begin{aligned} (x^2+6x) + 2(y^2+4y) &= 15 \\\\ (x^2+6x+9) + 2(y^2+4y+4) &= 15 + 9 + 2(4) = 32 \\\\ (x+3)^2 + 2(y+2)^2 &= 32. \\end{aligned} \\]Dividing through by $32$ puts this equation in standard form: \\[\\begin{aligned} \\\\ \\frac{(x+3)^2}{32} + \\frac{(y+2)^2}{16}& = 1. \\end{aligned}\\]It follows that the semimajor axis has length $\\sqrt{32} = 4\\sqrt{2},$ so the major axis has length $2 \\cdot 4\\sqrt{2} = \\boxed{8\\sqrt2}.$"
