    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "By the Integer Root Theorem, the possible integer roots are all the divisors of 8 (including negative divisors), which are $-8,$ $-4,$ $-2,$ $-1,$ $1,$ $2,$ $4,$ and $8.$  Checking, we find that the only integer roots are $\\boxed{-8,1}.$"
