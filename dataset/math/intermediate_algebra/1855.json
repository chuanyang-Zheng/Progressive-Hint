    "solution": "We make the substitution $y = \\left(\\frac{x}{x+1}\\right)^2$ to simplify the equation, so that \\[\\frac{y+11}{y+1} = 2.\\]Multiplying by $y+1$ gives $y+11 = 2y+2,$ so $y=9.$ Therefore, we have \\[\\frac{x}{x+1} = \\pm 3.\\]Then, either $x = 3(x+1)$ or $x = -3(x+1).$ These give solutions $x =\\boxed{ -\\tfrac32}$ and $x = \\boxed{-\\tfrac34},$ respectively."
