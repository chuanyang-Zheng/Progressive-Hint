    "problem": "Sasha and Chloe are throwing darts at a map of the complex plane. Sasha's dart lands on the point $15+8i$. Chloe's dart lands on the point $3-4i$. How much closer to the origin is Chloe's dart compared to Sasha's?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "The distance from one point to the origin is equivalent to the magnitude. The distance from Sasha's dart is $|15+8i| = \\sqrt{15^2 + 8^2} = 17$. The distance from Chloe's dart is $|3-4i| = \\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = 5$. We need to calculate the difference in the distances. Chloe's dart is closer by a distance of $17 - 5 = \\boxed{12}$."
