    "solution": "If $a$ is a root of both polynomials, then $a$ is also a root of the difference of the polynomials, which is\n\\[(x^3 + 7x^2 + px + r) - (x^3 + 5x^2 + px + q) = 2x^2 + (r - q) = 0.\\]And if $a$ is a root of this polynomial, so is $-a,$ and their sum is 0.\n\nBy Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of $x^3 + 5x^2 + px + q = 0$ is $-5,$ so the third root is $-5.$  Similarly, the third root of $x^3 + 7x^2 + px + r = 0$ is $-7,$ so $(x_1,x_2) = \\boxed{(-5,-7)}.$"
