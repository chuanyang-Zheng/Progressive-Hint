    "solution": "We multiply both sides by $(x-2)(x+2),$ giving \\[(x^2-3)(x-2) = 2x,\\]or \\[x^3 - 2x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0.\\]Noting that $x=1$ is a root of this equation, we can factor the equation as \\[(x-1)(x^2-x-6) = 0,\\]or \\[(x-1)(x-3)(x+2) = 0.\\]The given equation is undefined for $x = -2,$ so the only solutions are $\\boxed{1,3}.$"
