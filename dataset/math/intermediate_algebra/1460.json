    "problem": "The sequence 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 22, 23, 46, 47, $\\dots$ is formed as follows:\n\n$\\bullet$ Start with the number 1.\n\n$\\bullet$ Add one to get 2.\n\n$\\bullet$ Double that to get 4.\n\n$\\bullet$ Add one to get 5.\n\n$\\bullet$ Double that to get 10, and so on.\n\nWe repeat the steps of \"add one\" and \"double that\", alternating between them.\n\nThe 100th term will be of the form $3 \\cdot 2^k - 1.$  Compute $k.$",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "If we take every other term, starting with the second term 2, we get\n\\[2, 5, 11, 23, 47, \\dots.\\]If we add one to each of these terms, we get\n\\[3, 6, 12, 24, 48, \\dots.\\]Each term appear to be double the previous term.\n\nTo confirm this, let one term in the original sequence be $x - 1,$ after we have added 1.  Then the next term is $2(x - 1) = 2x - 2,$ and the next term after that is $2x - 2 + 1 = 2x - 1.$\n\nThis confirms that in the sequence 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, $\\dots,$ each term is double the previous term.  Then the 50th term in this geometric sequence is $3 \\cdot 2^{49},$ so the 100th term in the original sequence is $3 \\cdot 2^{49} - 1,$ so $k = \\boxed{49}.$"
