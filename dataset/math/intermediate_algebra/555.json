    "solution": "We can simplify the expression by finding a common denominator: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{x-1}-\\frac{1}{x-7}&>1\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n\\frac{x-7}{(x-1)(x-7)}-\\frac{x-1}{(x-1)(x-7)}&>1\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n\\frac{-6}{x^2-8x+7}&>1.\n\\end{align*}We would like to multiply both sides by $x^2-8x+7$, but we need to be careful: if $x^2-8x+7$ is negative, we will need to switch the inequality sign. We have two cases: $x^2-8x+7<0$ and $x^2-8x+7>0$. (Note that $x^2-8x+7\\neq 0$ since it is in the denominator of a fraction.)\n\nFirst let $x^2-8x+7>0$. Since the quadratic factors as $(x-7)(x-1)$, it changes sign at $x=7$ and $x=1$. Testing values reveals that the quadratic is positive for $x<1$ and $7<x$. Now since it is positive we can multiply both sides of the above inequality without changing the inequality sign, so we have  \\begin{align*}\n-6&>x^2-8x+7\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n0&>x^2-8x+13.\n\\end{align*}The roots of the equation $x^2-8x+13$ occur at $$\\frac{-(-8)\\pm\\sqrt{(-8)^2-4(1)(13)}}{2(1)}=\\frac{8\\pm\\sqrt{12}}{2}=4\\pm\\sqrt{3}.$$Testing reveals that $x^2-8x+13<0$ when $x$ has a value between the roots, so $4-\\sqrt{3}<x<4+\\sqrt{3}$. However, we also have that either $x<1$ or $x>7$. Since $4-\\sqrt{3}>1$ and $4+\\sqrt{3}<7$, we actually have no values of $x$ which satisfy both inequalities.\n\nThus we must have $x^2-8x+7<0$. This occurs when $1<x<7$. When we cross-multiply, we must switch the inequality sign, so we have \\begin{align*}\n-6&<x^2-8x+7\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n0&<x^2-8x+13.\n\\end{align*}We already know the roots of the equation $x^2-8x+13$ are $4\\pm\\sqrt{3}$, so the sign of the quadratic changes there. We test to find that the quadratic is negative when $x<4-\\sqrt{3}$ or $x>4+\\sqrt{3}$. Combining this with the inequality $1<x<7$ gives us two intervals on which the inequality is satisfied: $\\boxed{(1,4-\\sqrt{3})\\cup(4+\\sqrt{3},7)}$."
