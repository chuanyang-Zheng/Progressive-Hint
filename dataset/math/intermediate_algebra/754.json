    "solution": "Intuitively, $x$ will be largest for the option for which the value in the parentheses is smallest.\n\nFormally, first note that each of the values in parentheses is larger than $1$. Now, each of the options is of the form $3f(r)^x = 7$. This can be rewritten as $x\\log f(r) = \\log\\frac 73$. As $f(r)>1$, we have $\\log f(r)>0$. Thus $x$ is the largest for the option for which $\\log f(r)$ is smallest. As $\\log f(r)$ is an increasing function, this is the option for which $f(r)$ is smallest.\n\nWe now get the following easier problem: Given that $0<r<3$, find the smallest value in the set $\\{ 1+r, 1+r/10, 1+2r, 1+\\sqrt r, 1+1/r\\}$.\n\nClearly, $1+r/10$ is smaller than the first and the third option.\n\nWe have $r^2 < 10$, so dividing both sides by $10r$, we get $r/10 < 1/r$.\n\nFinally, $r/100 < 1$, therefore $r^2/100 < r$. Since both sides are positive, we can take the square root and get $r/10 < \\sqrt r$.\n\nThus the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(B)}} 3(1 + r/10)^x = 7$."
