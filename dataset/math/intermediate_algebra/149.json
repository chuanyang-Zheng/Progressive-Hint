    "problem": "Compute the product of the number $5+\\sqrt{3}$ and its radical conjugate.",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "The radical conjugate of this number is $5-\\sqrt{3},$ so the product of the two numbers is \\[(5+\\sqrt3)(5-\\sqrt3) = 5^2 - (\\sqrt3)^2 = 25 - 3 = \\boxed{22}.\\]"
