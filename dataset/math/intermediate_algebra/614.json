    "problem": "Which type of conic section is described by the equation \\[(x-y)(x+y) = -2y^2 + 1?\\]Enter \"C\" for circle, \"P\" for parabola, \"E\" for ellipse, \"H\" for hyperbola, and \"N\" for none of the above.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "We try to rewrite the given equation in a standard form for a conic section. Expanding the left-hand side, we get \\[x^2 - y^2 = -2y^2 + 1.\\]Then adding $2y^2$ to both sides gives \\[x^2 + y^2 = 1,\\]which is the equation for a $\\boxed{\\text{(C)}}$ circle (in fact, the unit circle centered at the origin)."
