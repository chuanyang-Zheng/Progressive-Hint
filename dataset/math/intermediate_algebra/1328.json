    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "The roots of $ax^2 + bx + c$ are rational if and only if the discriminant\n\\[b^2 - 4ac\\]is a perfect square.\n\nSimilarly, the roots of $4ax^2 + 12bx + kc = 0$ are rational if and only if its discriminant\n\\[(12b)^2 - 4(4a)(kc) = 144b^2 - 16kac\\]is a perfect square.\n\nTo narrow down the possible values of $k,$ we look at specific examples.  Take $a = 1,$ $b = 6,$ and $c = 9.$  Then $b^2 - 4ac = 0$ is a perfect square, and we want\n\\[144b^2 - 16kac = 5184 - 144k = 144 (36 - k)\\]to be a perfect square, which means $36 - k$ is a perfect square.  We can check that this occurs only for $k = 11,$ 20, 27, 32, 35, and 36.\n\nNow, take $a = 3,$ $b = 10,$ and $c = 3.$  Then $b^2 - 4ac = 64$ is a perfect square, and we want\n\\[144b^2 - 16kac = 14400 - 144k = 144 (100 - k)\\]to be a perfect square, which means $100 - k$ is a perfect square.  We can check that this occurs only for $k = 19,$ 36, 51, 64, 75, 84, 91, 96, 99, 100.  The only number in both lists is $k = 36.$\n\nAnd if $b^2 - 4ac$ is a perfect square, then\n\\[144b^2 - 16kac = 144b^2 - 576ac = 144 (b^2 - 4ac)\\]is a perfect square.  Hence, the only such value of $k$ is $\\boxed{36}.$"
