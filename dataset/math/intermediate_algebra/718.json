    "problem": "The graph of $y = f(x)$ passes through the point $(-4,-7).$  If $f(x)$ is an even function, then what other point must the graph pass through?  Enter your answer as an ordered pair.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Since $f(x)$ is an even function, $f(-x) = f(x).$  In particular,\n\\[f(4) = f(-4) = -7.\\]Therefore, the graph of $f(x)$ must also pass through the point $\\boxed{(4,-7)}.$"
