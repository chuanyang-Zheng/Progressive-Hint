Suppose that $\\left| a \\right| = 1$ and $g(g(z))=z$ for all $z$ for which $g(g(z))$ is defined. What is the difference between the largest and smallest possible values of $\\left| b \\right|$?",
    "level": "Level 5",

    "solution": "After a bit of algebra, we obtain:\n\\[h(z)=g(g(z))=f(f(f(f(z))))=\\frac{Pz+Q}{Rz+S},\\]where $P=(a+1)^2+a(b+1)^2$, $Q=a(b+1)(b^2+2a+1)$, $R=(b+1)(b^2+2a+1)$, and $S=a(b+1)^2+(a+b^2)^2$. In order for $h(z)=z$, we must have $R=0$, $Q=0$, and $P=S$. The first implies $b=-1$ or $b^2+2a+1=0$. The second implies $a=0$, $b=-1$, or $b^2+2a+1=0$. The third implies $b=\\pm1$ or $b^2+2a+1=0$.\n\nSince $|a|=1\\neq 0$, in order to satisfy all 3 conditions we must have either $b=1$ or $b^2+2a+1=0$. In the first case $|b|=1$. For the latter case, note that $|b^2+1|=|-2a|=2$, so $2=|b^2+1|\\leq |b^2|+1$ and hence $1\\leq|b|^2\\Rightarrow1\\leq |b|$. On the other hand, $2=|b^2+1|\\geq|b^2|-1$, so $|b^2|\\leq 3\\Rightarrow0\\leq |b|\\leq \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThus, $1\\leq |b|\\leq \\sqrt{3}$. Hence, in any case the maximum value for $|b|$ is $\\sqrt{3}$ while the minimum is $1$ (which can be achieved in the instance where $|a|=1,|b|=\\sqrt{3}$ or $|a|=1,|b|=1$ respectively). The answer is then $\\boxed{\\sqrt{3}-1}$."
