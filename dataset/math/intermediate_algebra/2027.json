    "solution": "Let\n\\[y = \\frac{x^2 + x + 1}{x^2 + 1}.\\]Then $x^2 + x + 1 = y(x^2 + 1),$ which we write as\n\\[(y - 1) x^2 - x + (y - 1) = 0.\\]If $y = 1,$ then this simplifies to $x = 0.$  In other words, $p(0) = 1.$  Otherwise, the equation above is a quadratic, whose discriminant is\n\\[1 - 4(y - 1)^2 = -4y^2 + 8y - 3.\\]For a given value of $y,$ the quadratic has a real solution in $x$ if and only if this discriminant is nonnegative.  Thus, we want to solve the inequality\n\\[-4y^2 + 8y - 3 \\ge 0.\\]We can factor this as\n\\[-(2y - 3)(2y - 1) \\ge 0.\\]The solution to this inequality is $\\frac{1}{2} \\le y \\le \\frac{3}{2}.$  Note that this interval includes the value of $p(0) = 1$ that we found above, so the range of the function is $\\boxed{\\left[ \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{2} \\right]}.$"
