    "problem": "The members of a distinguished committee were choosing a president, and each member gave one vote to one of the 27 candidates.  For each candidate, the exact percentage of votes the candidate got was smaller by at least 1 than the number of votes for that candidate. What is the smallest possible number of members of the committee?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $t$ be the number of members of the committee, $n_k$ be the number of votes for candidate $k$, and let $p_k$ be the percentage of votes for candidate $k$ for $k= 1,2, \\dots, 27$. We have $$n_k \\ge p_k+1 = {{100n_k}\\over t} +1.$$Adding these 27 inequalities yields $t \\ge 127$.\n\nSolving for $n_k$ gives $n_k \\ge \\displaystyle{t \\over{t-100}}$, and, since $n_k$ is an integer, we obtain $$n_k \\ge \\biggl\\lceil{t \\over{t-100}}\\biggr\\rceil,$$where the notation $\\lceil x\\rceil$ denotes the least integer that is greater than or equal to $x$. The last inequality is satisfied for all $k= 1,2, \\dots, 27$ if and only if it is satisfied by the smallest $n_k$, say $n_1$. Since $t \\ge 27n_1$, we obtain $$t \\ge 27 \\biggl\\lceil{t \\over {t-100}} \\bigg\\rceil \\quad (1)$$and our problem reduces to finding the smallest possible integer $t\\ge127$ that satisfies the inequality (1).\n\nIf ${t \\over {t-100}} > 4$, that is, $t \\le 133$, then $27\\left\\lceil{t\\over {t-100}}\\right\\rceil \\ge27 \\cdot5=135$ so that the inequality (1) is not satisfied. Thus $\\boxed{134}$ is the least possible number of members in the committee.  Note that when $t=134$, an election in which 1 candidate receives 30 votes and the remaining 26 candidates receive 4 votes each satisfies the conditions of the problem.\n\n$\\centerline{{\\bf OR}}$\n\nLet $t$ be the number of members of the committee, and let $m$ be the least number of votes that any candidate received.  It is clear that $m \\ne 0$ and $m \\ne 1$.  If $m=2$, then $2 \\ge 1+100 \\cdot \\frac{2}{t}$, so $t \\ge 200$.  Similarly, if $m=3$, then $3 \\ge 1+100 \\cdot \\frac{3}{t}$, and $t \\ge 150$; and if $m=4$, then $4 \\ge 1+100 \\cdot \\frac{4}{t}$, so $t \\ge 134$. When $m \\ge 5$, $t \\ge 27 \\cdot\n5=135$.  Thus $t \\ge 134$. Verify that $t$ can be $\\boxed{134}$ by noting that the votes may be distributed so that 1 candidate receives 30 votes and the remaining 26 candidates receive 4 votes each."
