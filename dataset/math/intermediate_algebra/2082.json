    "problem": "Factor $7x^3 - 21x^2 + 14x$.",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Both 7 and $x$ are factors of each term, so we can factor out $7x$: \\[7x^3 -21x^2 + 14x = (7x)\\cdot(x^2) - (7x)\\cdot (3x) + (7x)\\cdot 2 = 7x(x^2 - 3x + 2).\\]We can factor $x^2 - 3x + 2$ into $(x-1)(x-2)$, to get our answer of $\\boxed{7x(x-1)(x-2)}$."
