    "solution": "Since the remainder is $2x + 1$ when $f(x)$ is divided by $(x - 1)^2,$ we can write\n\\begin{align*}\nf(x) &= q(x) (x - 1)^2 + 2x + 1 \\\\\n&= q(x) (x - 1)^2 + 2(x - 1) + 3.\n\\end{align*}Then\n\\[\\frac{f(x) - 3}{x - 1} = q(x)(x - 1) + 2.\\]Let\n\\[g(x) = q(x)(x - 1) + 2.\\]By the Remainder Theorem, $f(3) = 15,$ so\n\\[g(3) = \\frac{f(3) - 3}{3 - 1} = \\frac{15 - 3}{3 - 1} = 6.\\]Also, $g(1) = 2.$\n\nLet $ax + b$ be the remainder when $g(x)$ is divided by $(x - 1)(x - 3),$ so\n\\[g(x) = q_1(x) (x - 1)(x - 3) + ax + b.\\]Setting $x = 1$ and $x = 3$ gives\n\\begin{align*}\na + b &= g(1) = 2, \\\\\n3a + b &= g(3) = 6.\n\\end{align*}Solving this system, we get $a = 2$ and $b = 0,$ so\n\\[g(x) = q_1(x)(x - 1)(x - 3) + 2x.\\]Then\n\\begin{align*}\nf(x) &= g(x) (x - 1) + 3 \\\\\n&= [q_1(x) (x - 1)(x - 3) + 2x](x - 1) + 3 \\\\\n&= q_1(x) (x - 1)^2 (x - 3) + 2x(x - 1) + 3 \\\\\n&= q_1(x) (x - 1)^2 (x - 3) + 2x^2 - 2x + 3.\n\\end{align*}This tells us that the remainder when $f(x)$ is divided by $(x - 3)(x - 1)^2$ is $\\boxed{2x^2 - 2x + 3}.$"
