    "solution": "Moving all the terms to the left-hand side, we have \\[z^4 + 4iz^3 - 6z^2 + (8-4i)z + (1+8i) = 0.\\]Seeing the coefficients $4$ and $6$ reminds us of the expansion for $(z+1)^4.$ To get terms such as $4iz^3$ which involve $i,$ we instead write \\[(z+i)^4 = z^4 + 4iz^3 - 6z^2 - 4iz + 1.\\]In view of this, the given equation is equivalent to \\[(z+i)^4 + 8z+8i=0,\\]or \\[(z+i)^4 = -8(z+i).\\]Making the substitution $w = z+i,$ we have \\[w^4 = -8w.\\]Because this substitution only translates the complex plane, the sum of the pairwise distances does not change if we work with this equation instead of the equation for $z.$ This equation implies that either $w=0$ or \\[w^3 = -8.\\]Every solution to $w^3 = -8$ has magnitude $2$, because taking magnitudes of both sides gives $|w^3| = |w|^3 = 8.$ Furthermore, if $w^3 = -8,$ then $w^6 = 64,$ so $w$ is two times a number that is a $6^{\\text{th}}$ root of unity that is not a $3^{\\text{rd}}$ root of unity. These complex numbers have arguments $\\tfrac\\pi3,$ $\\pi,$ and $\\tfrac{5\\pi}3$ in the complex plane, so they form an equilateral triangle: [asy]size(5cm);draw((-3,0)--(3,0),EndArrow);draw((0,-3)--(0,3),EndArrow);draw(Circle((0,0),2));dot((0,0)^^2*dir(60)^^2*dir(180)^^2*dir(300));draw(2*dir(60)--2*dir(180)--2*dir(300)--cycle,dotted);label(\"Re\",(3,0),E);label(\"Im\",(0,3),N);[/asy] This equilateral triangle has side length $2\\sqrt{3},$ so its perimeter is $6\\sqrt{3}.$ Together with the distances of $2$ from each vertex to the origin, we get the answer, $6\\sqrt{3} + 2(3) = \\boxed{6\\sqrt{3}+6}.$"
