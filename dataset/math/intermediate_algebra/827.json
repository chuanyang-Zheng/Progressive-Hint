    "problem": "A set $S$ is constructed as follows. To begin, $S = \\{0,10\\}$. Repeatedly, as long as possible, if $x$ is an integer root of some nonzero polynomial $a_{n}x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\dots + a_{1}x + a_0$ for some $n\\geq{1}$, all of whose coefficients $a_i$ are elements of $S$, then $x$ is put into $S$. When no more elements can be added to $S$, how many elements does $S$ have?",

    "solution": "We start with the set $S = \\{0,10\\}.$  We can construct the polynomial $10x + 10 = 0,$ which has $x = -1$ as a root.  Thus, we can expand our set to $S = \\{-1,0,10\\}.$\n\nWe can then construct the polynomial\n\\[10x^{10} - x^9 - x^8 - x^7 - x^6 - x^5 - x^4 - x^3 - x^2 - x - 1 = 0,\\]which has $x = 1$ as a root, and we can construct the polynomial $-x^3 - x + 10 = 0,$ which has $x = 2$ as a root.  Thus, we can expand our set to $S = \\{-1, 0, 1, 2, 10\\}.$\n\nNext, we can construct the polynomial $x + 10 = 0,$ which has $x = -10$ as a root, the polynomial $2x + 10 = 0,$ which has $x = -5$ as a root, and the polynomial $x + 2 = 0,$ which has $x = -2$ as a root.  Our set $S$ is now $\\{-10, -5, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 10\\}.$\n\nFinally, we can construct the polynomial $x - 5 = 0,$ which has $x = 5$ as a root, giving us the set\n\\[S = \\{-10, -5, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 5, 10\\}.\\]Now, suppose we construct the polynomial\n\\[a_n x^n + a_{n - 1} x^{n - 1} + \\dots + a_1 x + a_0 = 0,\\]with coefficients from the set $S = \\{-10, -5, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 5, 10\\}.$  If $a_0 = 0,$ then we can factor out some power of $x,$ to obtain a polynomial where the constant term is nonzero.  Thus, we can assume that $a_0 \\neq 0.$\n\nBy the Integer Root Theorem, any integer root of this polynomial must divide $a_0.$  But we see that any divisor of a non-zero element in $S$ already lies in $S,$ so we cannot expand the set $S$ any further.  Hence, the answer is $\\boxed{9}$ elements."
