    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "We have that\n\\[\\left|\\frac{64}{5}-\\frac{48}{5}i \\right|= \\left|\\frac{16}{5}(4-3i)\\right| = \\frac{16}{5}|4-3i| = \\frac{16}{5}(5) = 16.\\]We also have $|z|^4 = |z|\\cdot |z|\\cdot |z|\\cdot |z| = |(z)(z)(z)(z)| = |z^4|$, so $|z^4| = 16$ means that $|z|^4 = 16$, which gives us $|z| = 16^{\\frac{1}{4}} = \\boxed{2}$."
