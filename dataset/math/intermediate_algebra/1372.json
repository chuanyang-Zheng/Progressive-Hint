    "problem": "Let $O$ be the center and let $F$ be one of the foci of the ellipse $25x^2 +16 y^2 = 400$. A second ellipse, lying inside and tangent to the first ellipse, has its foci at $O$ and $F$. What is the length of the minor axis of this second ellipse?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Dividing by $400,$ we get the standard form of the equation for the first ellipse: \\[\\frac{x^2}{16}+\\frac{y^2}{25}=1.\\]Therefore, the semiaxes have lengths $\\sqrt{16}=4$ and $\\sqrt{25}=5,$ which means that the distance from the center $O=(0,0)$ to each focus is $\\sqrt{5^2-4^2}=3.$ Since the vertical axis is longer than the horizontal axis, it follows that the foci of the first ellipse are at $(0, \\pm 3).$\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.5 cm);\n\npair O = (0,0), F = (0,3);\npath ellone = yscale(5)*xscale(4)*Circle((0,0),1);\npath elltwo = shift((0,3/2))*yscale(7/2)*xscale(sqrt(10))*Circle((0,0),1);\n\ndraw((-5,0)--(5,0));\ndraw((0,-6)--(0,6));\ndraw(ellone);\ndraw(elltwo);\n\ndot(\"$F$\", F, E);\ndot(\"$O$\", O, NE);\ndot(\"$(0,5)$\", (0,5), NE);\n[/asy]\n\nWithout loss of generality, assume that $F=(0,3).$ Then the second ellipse must be tangent to the first ellipse at the point $(0, 5).$ The sum of the distances from $(0,5)$ to the foci of the second ellipse is $2 + 5 = 7,$ so the length of the major axis of the second ellipse is $7.$ Since the distance between the foci of the second ellipse is $3,$ the length of the minor axis of the second ellipse is \\[\\sqrt{7^2-3^2} = \\boxed{2\\sqrt{10}}.\\]"
