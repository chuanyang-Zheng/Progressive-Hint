    "problem": "Consider the sequence of numbers: $4,7,1,8,9,7,6,\\dots$ For $n>2$, the $n$-th term of the sequence is the units digit of the sum of the two previous terms. Let $S_n$ denote the sum of the first $n$ terms of this sequence. Find the smallest value of $n$ for which $S_n>10,000.$",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Writing out further terms of the sequence, we get\n\\[4, 7, 1, 8, 9, 7, 6, 3, 9, 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, \\dots.\\]Since each term depends only on the previous two terms, the sequence becomes periodic at this point, with period 12.\n\nSince $S_{12} = 60,$ $S_{12k} = 60k$ for all positive integers $k.$  Taking $k = 166,$ we get\n\\[S_{1992} = 60 \\cdot 166 = 9960.\\]Then $S_{1998} = 9996$ and $S_{1999} = 10002,$ so the smallest such $n$ is $\\boxed{1999}.$"
