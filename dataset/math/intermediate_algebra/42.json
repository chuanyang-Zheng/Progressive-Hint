    "problem": "The set of real numbers $x$ for which\n$$\\dfrac{1}{x-2009}+\\dfrac{1}{x-2010}+\\dfrac{1}{x-2011}\\ge 1$$is the union of intervals of the form $a<x\\le b$. What is the sum of the lengths of these intervals?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Because the problem asks for the sum of the lengths of the intervals, we can replace $x$ with $x-2010,$ and the answer will not change. Then we have the inequality $$\\frac{1}{x+1}+\\frac{1}{x}+\\frac{1}{x-1}\\ge1.$$Let $f(x)=\\frac{1}{x+1}+\\frac{1}{x}+\\frac{1}{x-1}$. Note that $f(x)$ has three vertical asymptotes at $x=-1, 0, 1.$ Since the function $g(x) = 1/x$ is decreasing over every connected interval on which it is defined, the same is true of $f(x).$ That is, $f(x)$ is decreasing on each of the intervals $(-\\infty, -1),$ $(-1, 0),$ $(0,1),$ and $(1, \\infty).$\n\nAs $x$ approaches $\\infty$ and as $x$ approaches $-\\infty,$ we see that $f(x)$ approaches $0.$ And as $x$ approaches each of the vertical asymptotes $x=-1, 0, 1$ from the left, $f(x)$ approaches $-\\infty,$ while as $x$ approaches each of the vertical asymptotes from the right, $f(x)$ approaches $\\infty.$ This lets us sketch the graph of $f(x),$ as shown below:\n[asy]\nsize(12cm);\nvoid axes(real x0, real x1, real y0, real y1)\n{\n    draw((x0,0)--(x1,0),EndArrow);\n    draw((0,y0)--(0,y1),EndArrow);\n    label(\"$x$\",(x1,0),E);\n    label(\"$y$\",(0,y1),N);\n    for (int i=floor(x0)+1; i<x1; ++i)\n        draw((i,.1)--(i,-.1));\n    for (int i=floor(y0)+1; i<y1; ++i)\n        draw((.1,i)--(-.1,i));\n}\naxes(-5.9,7,-4.6,5);\nreal f(real x) { return 1/(x+1) + 1/x + 1/(x-1); }\ndraw(graph(f,-5.5,-1.4),Arrows);\ndraw((-1,-4.5)--(-1,4.5),dotted);\ndraw(graph(f,-.84,-.23),Arrows);\ndraw(graph(f,.2,.82),Arrows);\ndraw((1,-4.5)--(1,4.5),dotted);\ndraw(graph(f,1.3,6.5),Arrows);\ndraw((-2,1)--(5,1),blue,Arrows);\ndot((-.675,1)^^(.4608,1)^^(3.214,1),blue);\n[/asy]\nTherefore, the equation $f(x) = 1$ has three roots $p, q, r,$ where $p \\in (-1, 0),$ $q \\in (0, 1),$ and $r \\in (1, \\infty).$ In terms of these roots, the values of $x$ such that $f(x) \\ge 1$ are \\[(-1, p] \\cup (0, q] \\cup (1, r].\\]The sum of the lengths of the three intervals above is $(p+1) + q + (r-1) = p+q+r,$ so we want to find the sum of the roots of $f(x) = 1.$\n\nMultiplying the equation $f(x) = \\frac1{x+1} + \\frac1x + \\frac1{x-1} = 1$ by $(x+1)x(x-1)$ and then rearranging, we get the cubic equation \\[x^3 - 3x^2 - x + 1 = 0.\\]By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of this equation is $\\boxed{3}.$"
