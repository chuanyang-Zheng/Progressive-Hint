    "problem": "Compute the area of the circle that passes through all the intersection points of $4x^2 + 11y^2 = 29$ and $x^2 - 6y^2 = 6.$",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Adding the equations, we get $5x^2 + 5y^2 = 35,$ so $x^2 + y^2 = 7.$  (Any point that satisfies the two equations given in the problem must also satisfy this equation.)  Hence, the area of the circle is $\\boxed{7 \\pi}.$"
