    "problem": "Compute the number of ordered pairs of complex numbers $(u, v)$ such that $uv = 10$ and such that the real and imaginary parts of $u$ and $v$ are integers.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Because $u$ and $v$ have integer parts, $|u|^2$ and $|v|^2$ are nonnegative integers. From $uv = 10$, it follows that $|u|^2 \\cdot |v|^2 = 100$. So $|u|^2$ and $|v|^2$ are positive integers whose product is $100$. We will divide the count into three cases: $|u| < |v|$, $|u| = |v|$, and $|u| > |v|$.\n\nLet’s handle the case $|u| < |v|$ first. In that case, $|u|^2$ is a small divisor of $100$: either $1, 2, 4$, or $5$.\n\nIf $|u|^2 = 1$, then we have $4$ choices for $u$: either $\\pm1$ or $\\pm i$.\n\nIf $|u|^2=2$, then we have $4$ choices: $\\pm 1 \\pm i$.\n\nIf $|u|^2= 4$, then we have $4$ choices: $\\pm 2$ or $\\pm 2i$.\n\nIf $|u|^2 = 5$, then we have $8$ choices: $\\pm 1 \\pm 2i$ or $\\pm 2 \\pm i$.\n\nAltogether, we have $20$ choices for $u$. Each such choice gives a single valid choice for $v$, namely $v = \\frac{10}{u} = \\frac{10\\overline{u}}{|u|^2}$. So we have $20$ pairs in the case $|u| < |v|$.\n\nLet’s next handle the case $|u| = |v|$. In that case, $|u|^2 = |v|^2 = 10$. So we have $8$ choices for $u$: either $\\pm1\\pm 3i$ or $\\pm 3\\pm i$. Each such choice determines $v$, namely $v = 10/u = u$. So we have $8$ pairs in the case $|u| = |v|$.\n\nFinally, we have the case $|u| > |v|$. By symmetry, it has the same count as the first case $|u| < |v|$. So we have $20$ pairs in this case.\n\nAltogether, the number of pairs is $20 + 8 + 20$, which is $\\boxed{48}$ ."
