    "problem": "Consider the following six statements:\n\n1. $x < x^2 < x^3$\n2. $x < x^3 < x^2$\n4. $x^2 < x < x^3$\n8. $x^2 < x^3 < x$\n16. $x^3 < x < x^2$\n32. $x^3 < x^2 < x$\n\n\nEnter the sum of the labels of statement that hold for some value of $x.$  For example, if you think the statements with labels 2 and 8 hold for some value of $x,$ then enter $2 + 8 = 10.$",

    "solution": "If $x < -1,$ then\n\\[x^3 < x < x^2.\\]If $x = -1,$ then $x = x^3 = -1$ and $x^2 = 1.$\n\nIf $-1 < x < 0,$ then\n\\[x < x^3 < x^2.\\]If $x = 0,$ then $x = x^2 = x^3 = 0.$\n\nIf $0 < x < 1,$ then\n\\[x^3 < x^2 < x.\\]If $x = 1,$ then $x = x^2 = x^3 = 1.$\n\nIf $x > 1,$ then\n\\[x < x^2 < x^3.\\]Thus, the only statements that can hold are the ones with labels 16, 2, 32, and 1, and their sum is $\\boxed{51}.$"
