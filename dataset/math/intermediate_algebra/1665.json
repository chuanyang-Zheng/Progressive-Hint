    "problem": "Let $f(x)$ be a polynomial with real coefficients such that $f(0) =\n1$, $f(2) + f(3) = 125,$ and for all $x$, $f(x)f(2x^2) = f(2x^3 +\nx)$. Find $f(5)$.",
    "level": "Level 5",

    "solution": "If the leading term of $f(x)$ is $a x^m$, then the leading term of $f(x)f(2x^2)$ is\n\\[ax^m \\cdot a(2x^2)^m = 2^ma^2x^{3m},\\]and the leading term of $f(2x^3 + x)$ is $2^max^{3m}$. Hence $2^ma^2 = 2^ma$, and $a =1$.\n\nBecause $f(0) = 1$, the product of all the roots of $f(x)$ is $\\pm 1$. If $f(\\lambda)=0$, then $f(2\\lambda^3+\\lambda)= 0$. Assume that there exists a root $\\lambda$ with $|\\lambda | \\neq 1$. Then there must be such a root $\\lambda_1$ with $|\\lambda_1|>1$. Then\n\\[|2\\lambda^3+\\lambda | \\geq 2|\\lambda |^3-|\\lambda | > 2|\\lambda |-|\\lambda |= |\\lambda |.\\]But then $f(x)$ would have infinitely many roots, given by $\\lambda_{k+1}=2\\lambda_k^3+\\lambda_k$, for $k \\geq 1$. Therefore $|\\lambda |=1$ for all of the roots of the polynomial.\n\nThus $\\lambda \\overline{\\lambda} = 1$, and $(2\\lambda^3+\\lambda)\\overline{(2\\lambda^3+\\lambda)}= 1$. Solving these equations simultaneously for $\\lambda = a+bi$ yields $a=0$, $b^2 = 1$, and so $\\lambda^2=-1$. Because the polynomial has real coefficients, the polynomial must have the form $f(x) = (1+ x^2)^n$ for some integer $n \\geq 1$. The condition $f(2) + f(3) = 125$ implies $n = 2$, giving $f(5) = \\boxed{676}$."
