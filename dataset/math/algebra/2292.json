    "problem": "If $A\\ \\spadesuit\\ B$ is defined as $A\\ \\spadesuit\\ B = A + B + 4$, what is the value of $A$ for which $A\\ \\spadesuit\\ 2 = 19$?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "From the definition of $A\\; \\spadesuit \\;B$, we can rewrite $A\\;\\spadesuit \\;2$ as $A\\;\\spadesuit \\;2 = A + 2+ 4$. So, now the equation $A\\;\\spadesuit \\;2=19$ becomes $A+2+4=19$, from which we find $A=\\boxed{13}$."
