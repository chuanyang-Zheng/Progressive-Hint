    "problem": "Let $t=2s-s^2$ and $s=n^2 - 2^n+1$. What is the value of $t$ when $n=3$?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "First substitute $n=3$ into the expression for $s$ to find $s=3^2 - 2^3 + 1 = 9-8+1=2$.  Then substitute $s=2$ into the expression for $t$ to find $t=2(2) - 2^2 =\\boxed{0}$."
