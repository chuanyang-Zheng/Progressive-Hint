    "problem": "If $9^{18n}=27^{24}$, find $n$.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Expressing both sides of the equation in terms of 3 as a base, we get $(3^2)^{18n}=(3^3)^{24}$, or $3^{36n}=3^{72}$. Setting the exponents equal, we get that $36n=72$, or $n=\\frac{72}{36}=\\boxed{2}$."
