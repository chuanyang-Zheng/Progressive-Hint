    "problem": "The midpoint of the line segment between $(x,y)$ and $(-9,1)$ is $(3,-5)$. Find $(x,y)$.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Applying the midpoint formula gives us $$\\left(\\frac{-9+x}{2},\\frac{1+y}{2}\\right)=(3,-5).$$Solving $\\frac{-9+x}{2} =3$ for $x$ and solving $\\frac{1+y}{2}=-5$ for $y$, we find the coordinates $(x,y)$ to be $\\boxed{(15,-11)}$."
