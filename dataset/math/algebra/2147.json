    "problem": "A parabola with equation $y=ax^2+bx+c$ has a vertical line of symmetry at $x=1$ and goes through the two points $(-1,3)$ and $(2,-2)$. The quadratic $ax^2 + bx +c$  has two real roots. The greater root is $\\sqrt{n}+1$. What is $n$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Rewrite the equation of the parabola as $y=a(x-h)^2+k$, where $a$, $h$, and $k$ are constants and $(h,k)$ are the coordinates of the vertex. If the parabola has a vertical line of symmetry at $x=1$, then the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $x=1$, so $h=1$. The equation of the parabola becomes $y=a(x-1)^2+k$. Plugging in the two given points into this equation, we have the two equations \\begin{align*}\n3&=a(-1-1)^2+k \\Rightarrow 3=4a+k\\\\\n-2&=a(2-1)^2+k \\Rightarrow -2=a+k\n\\end{align*} Subtracting the second equation from the first yields $5=3a$, so $a=5/3$. Plugging this value into the second equation to solve for $k$, we find that $k=-11/3$. So the equation of the parabola is $y=\\frac{5}{3}(x-1)^2-\\frac{11}{3}$. To find the zeros of the parabola, we set $y=0$ and solve for $x$: \\begin{align*}\n0&=\\frac{5}{3}(x-1)^2-\\frac{11}{3}\\\\\n\\frac{11}{3}&=\\frac{5}{3}(x-1)^2 &\\\\\n\\frac{11}{5}&=(x-1)^2\\\\\nx &= \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{11}{5}}+1\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe greater zero is at $x=\\sqrt{\\frac{11}{5}}+1$, so $n=\\boxed{2.2}$. The graph of the parabola is below:\n\n[asy]\nLabel f;\n\nf.p=fontsize(4);\n\nxaxis(-1,3,Ticks(f, 1.0));\n\nyaxis(-4,3,Ticks(f, 1.0));\n\nreal f(real x)\n\n{\n\nreturn 5/3*(x-1)^2-11/3;\n\n}\n\ndraw(graph(f,-1,3));\n[/asy]"
