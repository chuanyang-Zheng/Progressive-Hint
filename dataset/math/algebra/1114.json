    "problem": "At a certain amusement park, there is a bulk discount for tickets. If you buy up to 60 tickets in one order, the price for each ticket is $\\$70$. However if you buy more than 60 tickets in a single order, the price of every ticket is reduced by $\\$1$ for each additional ticket bought. If $t$ is the number of tickets bought in bulk at one time, what is the largest $t$ which will bring the amusement park a profit greater than $\\$4200$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Letting $t$ equal the number of tickets sold in a single order, we get the following inequality: \\begin{align*} 4200&<(70-(t-60))(t)\n\\\\4200&<(130-t)(t)\n\\\\4200&<130t-t^2\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad t^2-130t+4200&<0\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad (t-60)(t-70)&<0\n\\end{align*}Since the two roots of the left-hand side are 60 and 70, the inequality must change sign at these two points. For $t<60$, both factors of the inequality are negative, thus making it positive. For $60<t<70$, only $t-70$ is negative, so the inequality is negative. Finally, for $t>70$, both factors are positive, making the inequality positive once again. This tells us that the range of $t$ that will result in a profit greater than $\\$4200$ is $(60,70)$. Since the number of tickets purchased in one order must be an integer, the largest number of tickets which brings a profit greater than $\\$4200$ is $t=\\boxed{69}$."
