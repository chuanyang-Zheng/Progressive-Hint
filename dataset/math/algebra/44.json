    "problem": "At which point do the lines $s=9-2t$ and $t=3s+1$ intersect? Give your answer as an ordered pair in the form $(s, t).$",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to get  $$s=9-2(3s+1)=9-6s-2.$$Moving the variable terms to the left-hand side and the constants to the right-hand side, we find $$s+6s=7.$$This gives  $s=1$ which we may plug into either equation to get $t$. For example, $$t=3(1)+1=4.$$So the lines intersect at the point $\\boxed{(1,4)}$."
