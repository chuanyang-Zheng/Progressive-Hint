    "problem": "$P$ and $Q$ represent numbers, and $P \\ast Q$ means $\\cfrac{P+Q}{2}$. What is the value of $3 \\ast (6 \\ast 8)$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "According to the order of operations, first perform the operation indicated in the parentheses.\n\n$6 \\ast 8 = \\cfrac{6+8}{2}$ or 7. Then $3 \\ast (6 \\ast 8) = 3 \\ast 7 = \\cfrac{3+7}{2}$ or $\\boxed{5}$."
