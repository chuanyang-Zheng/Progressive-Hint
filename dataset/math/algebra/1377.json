    "problem": "A tree is now 12 feet tall and grows 18 inches a year. In how many years will the tree be 36 feet tall?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "From 12 feet to 36 feet, the tree will grow 24 feet.  If it grows at a rate of 1.5 feet per year, then it will take the tree $\\frac{24}{1.5}=\\boxed{16}$ years to reach a height of 36 feet."
