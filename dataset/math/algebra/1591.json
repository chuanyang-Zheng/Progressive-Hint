    "problem": "Three people are standing on a Cartesian coordinate plane. Robert is standing at point $(4,3)$, Lucy at point $(6,1)$, and Liz at point $(1,7)$. How many units away is the farther person from Robert?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We find the distance the two girls are to Robert by using the distance formula.\nLucy: $\\sqrt{(6-4)^2+(1-3)^2} = \\sqrt{8}$\nLiz: $\\sqrt{(1-4)^2+(7-3)^2}=\\sqrt{25}=5$\nLiz is farther away from Robert, and the distance is $\\boxed{5}$ units."
