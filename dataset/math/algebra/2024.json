    "problem": "If Wonder Woman can capture 6 criminals in an hour, how many can she capture in $4\\frac{1}{2}$ hours?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "To find the number of criminals that Wonder Woman can capture in $4 \\frac{1}{2}$ hours, we multiply how many criminals she can capture per hour by the number of hours she spends capturing criminals. Thus, she can capture $6 \\cdot (4 \\frac{1}{2})=6 \\cdot \\frac{9}{2} = \\boxed{27}$ criminals in $4 \\frac{1}{2}$ hours."
