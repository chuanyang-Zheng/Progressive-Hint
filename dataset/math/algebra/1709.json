    "problem": "If $p(t)$ and $q(t)$ are both seventh-degree polynomials in $t$, what is the degree of $p(t)\\cdot q(t)$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The $t^7$ terms multiply to a $t^{14}$ term.  All the other terms multiply to terms of lesser degree, so the degree of the product of polynomials is $\\boxed{14}$."
