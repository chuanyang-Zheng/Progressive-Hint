    "problem": "Find $y$: $\\sqrt{19+3y} = 7$.",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Squaring both sides of this equation, we have that $19+3y=49$. Now, we subtract $19$ from both sides of the equation and then divide by $3$ to get that $3y = 30 \\Rightarrow y = \\boxed{10}$."
