    "problem": "Together, Amy and Betty have 20 apples. Amy has three times the number of apples that Betty has. How many more apples than Betty does Amy have?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Call the amount of apples Amy has $a$ and the amount of apples Betty has $b$. We can use the following system of equations to represent the given information: \\begin{align*}\na + b &= 20 \\\\\na &= 3b \\\\\n\\end{align*}Substituting for $a$ into the first equation gives $3b + b = 20$. Solving for $b$ gives $b = 5$. Thus $a = 15$. So Amy has $15 - 5 = \\boxed{10}$ more apples than Betty."
