    "problem": "The sum of the product and the sum of two positive integers is $454$. Find the largest possible value of the product of their sum and their product.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "With word problems, the first step is to translate the words into equations. Let the two numbers be $a$ and $b$. Then their sum is $a+b$ and their product is $ab$. The sum of their product and their sum is $a+b+ab$. So we know  \\begin{align*}\nab+a+b&=454\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\na(b+1)+(b+1)&=454+1\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n(a+1)(b+1)&=455.\n\\end{align*}The prime factorization of $455$ is $5\\cdot 7\\cdot 13$. Since the equation is symmetric with $a$ and $b$, we may (without loss of generality) suppose that $a<b$. Thus $a+1<b+1$, so in each factor pair the smaller factor is equal to $a+1$. We list all possibilities: \\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}\n$a+1$&$b+1$&$a$&$b$\\\\ \\hline\n$1$&$455$&$0$&$454$\\\\\n$5$&$91$&$4$&$90$\\\\\n$7$&$65$&$6$&$64$\\\\\n$13$&$35$&$12$&$34$\n\\end{tabular}We must find the largest possible value of \"the product of their sum and their product\", or $ab\\cdot(a+b)$. We know the first possibility above gives a value of zero, while all the others will be greater than zero. We check: \\begin{align*}\n4\\cdot 90\\cdot (4+90)&=4\\cdot 90\\cdot 94=33840\\\\\n6\\cdot 64\\cdot (6+64)&=6\\cdot 64\\cdot 70=26880\\\\\n12\\cdot 34\\cdot (12+34)&=12\\cdot 34\\cdot 46=18768.\n\\end{align*}Thus the largest possible desired value is $\\boxed{33840}$, achieved when $(a,b)=(4,90)$."
