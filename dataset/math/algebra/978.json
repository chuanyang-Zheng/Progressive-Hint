    "problem": "Suppose $2a-3b = -23$. Given that $a$ and $b$ are consecutive integers, and $a<b$, what is the value of $a$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Note that $b = a+1$. Substituting, we obtain $2a-3(a+1) = -23$. Note that $2a-3(a+1) = 2a-3a-3 = -a-3$. Since $-a-3 = -23$, we have that $a = \\boxed{20}$."
