    "problem": "Lines $y=(3a+2)x-2$ and $2y=(a-4)x+2$ are parallel. What is the value of $a$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We find the slopes of the two lines and set them equal to each other, since parallel lines have the same slope. This gives $3a+2=\\frac{a}{2}-2$, which implies $a=\\boxed{-\\frac{8}{5}}$."
