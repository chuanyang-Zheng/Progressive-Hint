    "problem": "Two bricklayers, Alan and David, each place 30 bricks per hour. Alan worked three times as many hours as David, and the two of them placed a total of 600 bricks. How many bricks did David lay?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $t$ equal the amount of time David worked. Therefore, Alan worked $3t$ hours. They placed a total of $30 \\cdot t +30 \\cdot 3t=600$ bricks. Solving for $t$, we find that $t=5$ hours. Therefore, David placed $30 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{150}$ bricks."
