    "problem": "Find a non-zero value for $a$ such that $ax^2+8x+4=0$ has only one solution.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "For a quadratic to have only one solution, the discriminant must be zero. Therefore, we have $8^2-4 \\cdot a \\cdot 4 = 0$. Solving, we get $8^2-4 \\cdot a \\cdot 4 = 64-16a = 0$. Thus, $64=16a$, so $a=\\boxed{4}$."
