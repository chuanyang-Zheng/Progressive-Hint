    "problem": "If $3n+m=14$ and $n+m=1$, find the value of $n-m$.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If we multiply the second equation by $-2$, the given equations become  \\begin{align*}\n3n +m & =14\\text{, and} \\\\\n-2n -2m & =-2.\n\\end{align*}Summing these equations gives $n-m=\\boxed{12}$. (Notice that we didn't have to find $n$ or $m$ in order to find $n-m$.)"
