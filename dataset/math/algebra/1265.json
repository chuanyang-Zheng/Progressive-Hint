    "problem": "What power of 4 is equal to 8? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We are asked to solve $4^x=8$ for $x$.  Writing $4$ as $2^2$ and $8$ as $2^3$, the equation becomes $(2^2)^x=2^3$.  The left-hand side simplifies to $2^{2x}$, so we may set exponents equal to find $2x=3$, which implies $x=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$."
