    "problem": "Find the smallest integer $n$ for which the sum of the integers from $-25$ to $n$ (including $-25$ and $n$) is at least $26$.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The sum of the numbers from $-25$ to 25 is 0, because each number besides 0 cancels with its negative.  Therefore, when we add $-25$ through 26, we have a total of 26.  So, the desired smallest integer is $\\boxed{26}$."
