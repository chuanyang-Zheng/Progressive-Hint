    "problem": "What is the distance between the points with coordinates $(-5,5)$ and $(5,-5)$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We use the distance formula: $\\sqrt{(5-(-5))^2 + ((-5) - 5)^2} = \\sqrt{100 + 100} = \\boxed{10\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\n- OR -\n\nWe note that the points $(-5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, and $(-5, -5)$ form an isosceles right triangle (a 45-45-90 triangle) with legs of length 10. Therefore, the hypotenuse has length $\\boxed{10\\sqrt 2}$."
