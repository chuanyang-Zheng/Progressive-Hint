The diameter            of each circle is half the diameter of the previous            circle. What is the number of square inches in the         sum of the areas of all circles?

    "solution": "The radii of the circles form a geometric sequence with first term $\\frac{16}{2} = 8$ and common ratio $\\frac12$. Therefore the radius of the $n^{th}$ circle is $8\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{n-1}$. The area of the $n^{th}$ circle is thus $\\pi\\left[8\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{n-1}\\right]^2 = 64\\pi\\left(\\frac14\\right)^{n-1}$.\n\nThe sum of the areas of all the circles is therefore: $$A = 64\\pi+16\\pi+4\\pi+1\\pi+\\frac{1}{4}\\pi\\cdots.$$This is an infinite geometric series with first term $64\\pi$ and common ratio $\\frac14$, so it's sum is: $$A=\\frac{64\\pi}{1-\\frac14}=\\frac{256\\pi}{3}$$Using the approximation $\\pi\\approx\\frac{22}{7} = 3.1428\\ldots$ this is approximately: $$A\\approx\\frac{256}{3}\\cdot\\frac{22}{7} = \\frac{5632}{21}\\approx\\boxed{268}.$$"
