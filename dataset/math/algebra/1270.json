    "problem": "Let $a$ and $b$ be the solutions of the equation $2x^2-10x+5=0$. What is the value of $(2a-3)(4b-6)$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Expanding the desired expression, we get $(2a-3)(4b-6)=8ab-12a-12b+18=8ab-12(a+b)+18$. This implies that we need the sum and product of the roots of the given equation, which are $10/2=5$ and $5/2$, respectively. Thus, the desired expression equals $\\left(8\\cdot \\frac{5}{2}\\right) - (12 \\cdot 5) + 18 = \\boxed{-22}$."
