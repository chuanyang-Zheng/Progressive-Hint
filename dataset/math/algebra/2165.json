    "problem": "If $60$ miles per hour is $88$ feet per second, how many feet per second is $66$ miles per hour? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We have $60 \\text{ miles per hour} = 88 \\text{ feet per second}$. Multiplying both sides by $66/60$, we have $66 \\text{ miles per hour} = \\frac{66}{60} \\cdot 88 \\text{ feet per second} = \\boxed{96.8} \\text{ feet per second}$."
