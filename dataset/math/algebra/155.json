    "problem": "Paula invests $\\$10,\\!000$ for 5 years at an interest rate of $10\\%$ per year. If the interest is simple interest, how much is her investment worth at the end of those five years?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If the interest is simple interest, then she earns $0.1(\\$10,\\!000) = \\$1,\\!000$ each year.  Therefore, at the end of 5 years, she has earned $5(\\$1,\\!000) = \\$5,\\!000$.  So, her investment is now worth $\\$10,\\!000 + \\$5,\\!000 = \\boxed{\\$15,\\!000}$."
