    "problem": "How many integers belong to the arithmetic sequence 13, 20, 27, 34, $\\dots$, 2008?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The common difference is $20 - 13 = 7$.  If there are $n$ terms in this sequence, then $13 + 7(n - 1) = 2008$.  Solving for $n$, we find $n = \\boxed{286}$."
