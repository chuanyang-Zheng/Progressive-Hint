    "problem": "Five people can mow a lawn in 12 hours.  How many more people are needed to mow the lawn in just 3 hours, assuming each person mows at the same rate?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The number of people mowing and the time required to mow are inversely proportional. Letting $n$ be the number of people and $t$ be the amount of time, we have $nt = (5)(12)= 60$ because 5 people can mow a lawn in 12 hours. If $m$ people can mow the lawn in 3 hours, then we must have $m(3) = 60$, so $m=20$.  Therefore, we need to add $20-5 = \\boxed{15}$ people to the job."
