    "problem": "Consider the function \\[ f(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\nax^2 & \\text{if } x \\geq a,\\\\\nax +2a& \\text{if } x <a,\n\\end{cases}\n\\]where $a$ is some number.\n\nWhat is the largest value of $a$ such that the graph of $y=f(x)$ intersects every horizontal line at least once?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "For $x < a,$ the graph of $y = f(x)$ is the same as the graph of $y = ax+2a,$ which is a line with slope $a$ and which passes through the point $(a, a^2+2a).$ For $x \\ge a,$ the graph of $y = f(x)$ is the same as the graph of $y = ax^2,$ which is a parabola passing through the point $(a, a^3).$\n\nNotice that the parabola only ever takes nonnegative values. Therefore, the line portion of the graph must have positive slope, because it must intersect horizontal lines which lie below the $x-$axis. Thus, $a > 0.$\n\nFor $a > 0,$ the line portion of the graph passes through all horizontal lines with height less than or equal to $a^2+2a,$ and the parabola portion of the graph passes through all horizontal lines with height greater than or equal to $a^3.$ Therefore, all horizontal lines are covered if and only if \\[a^2 + 2a \\ge a^3.\\]Since $ a > 0,$ we can divide by $a$ to get \\[a + 2 \\ge a^2,\\]so $0 \\ge a^2 - a - 2 = (a-2) ( a+1).$ This means that $-1 \\le a \\le 2,$ so the greatest possible value of $a$ is $\\boxed{2}.$\n\nThe graph of $y = f(x)$ for $a = 2$ is shown below (not to scale); note how the parabola and line meet at one point: [asy]\nsize(8cm);\nimport graph;\n\nreal a =2;\ndraw((-5,0)--(6,0),EndArrow());\ndraw((0,-6)--(0,14),EndArrow());\n\nreal g(real x) {return 0.5*a*(x-a)^2+a^3;}\nreal f(real x) {return a*x+2*a;}\n\ndraw(graph(f,-4.6,a),BeginArrow());\ndraw(graph(g,a,4.5),EndArrow());\n\nlabel(\"$f(x)$\",(0,15.5));\nlabel(\"$x$\",(6,0),E);\ndot((2,8));\n[/asy]"
