    "problem": "A line segment has one endpoint at $(6,8)$ and midpoint at $(1,1)$. What is the sum of the coordinates of the other endpoint?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the other endpoint have coordinates $(x,y)$. We have the equations $(x+6)/2=1$ and $(y+8)/2=1$, or $x=-4$ and $y=-6$. The sum of the coordinates is thus $-4+(-6)=\\boxed{-10}$."
