    "problem": "What is the 2003rd term of the sequence of odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, $\\dots$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The sequence of odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on, is an arithmetic sequence, with common difference 2.  Therefore, the $2003^{\\text{rd}}$ term is $1+2002\\cdot2=\\boxed{4005}$."
