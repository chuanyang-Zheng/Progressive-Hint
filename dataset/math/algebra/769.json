    "problem": "The sum of the first $N$ positive odd numbers is 121. What is the value of $N$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The first $N$ positive odd integers are 1, 3, $\\dots$, $2N - 1$.  The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum of the first $N$ positive odd integers is \\[\\frac{1 + (2N - 1)}{2} \\cdot N = N^2.\\]If $N^2 = 121$, then $N = \\boxed{11}$."
