    "problem": "The points $(1,-2)$ and $(-4,10)$ are adjacent vertices of a square. What is the perimeter of the square?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The side length of the square is the distance between the given points, or $\\sqrt{(1 - (-4))^2 + ((-2) - 10)^2} = \\sqrt{5^2 + 12^2} = 13$. The perimeter of the square is four times the side length, or $4 \\times 13 = \\boxed{52}$."
