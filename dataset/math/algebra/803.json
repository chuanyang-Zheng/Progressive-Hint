    "problem": "Masha has a quadratic of the form $x^2+bx+1$, where $b$ is a specific positive number. Using her knowledge of how to complete the square, Masha is able to rewrite this quadratic in the form $(x+m)^2-63$. What is $b$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The expansion of $(x+m)^2-63$ is $x^2+2mx+m^2-63$, which has a constant term of $m^2-63$. This constant term must be equal to the constant term of the original quadratic, so $m^2-63 = 1$, which yields the possibilities $m=8$ and $m=-8$.\n\nIf $m=8$, then $(x+m)^2-63 = x^2+16x+1$. If $m=-8$, then $(x+m)^2-63 = x^2-16x+1$. Of these two possibilities, only the first conforms to our information that $b$ was a positive number. So, the original quadratic was $x^2+16x+1$, giving $b=\\boxed{16}$."
