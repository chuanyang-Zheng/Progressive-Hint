    "problem": "Solve for $a$: $\\frac15|9+2a|<1$.  Express your answer in interval notation.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Multiplying by 5 gives $|9+2a|<5$, so we must have  $$-5 < 9+2a < 5.$$Subtracting 9 from all three parts of this inequality chain gives  $$-14 < 2a < -4,$$and dividing by 2 gives $-7 < a < -2,$ or $a \\in \\boxed{(-7, -2)}$ in interval notation."
