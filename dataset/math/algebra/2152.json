    "problem": "If the system of equations  \\begin{align*}\n4x-3y&=2a,\\\\\n2x+y&=3a,\n\\end{align*}has a solution $(x,y)$ when $x=3$, compute $a$.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Substituting in $x=3$, we obtain the equations \\begin{align*}\n12-3y&=2a,\\\\\n6+y&=3a.\n\\end{align*}Multiplying the second equation by $3$ and adding it to the first equation, we find $$30=11a\\Rightarrow a=\\boxed{\\frac{30}{11}}.$$"
