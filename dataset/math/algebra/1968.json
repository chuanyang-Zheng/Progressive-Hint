    "problem": "One root of the equation $5x^2+4x=k$ (for some real $k$) is 2. What is the other?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Rearranging the given equation, we get $5x^2+4x-k=0$. That means that the sum of the roots of the equation is $-4/5$. If one of the roots of the equation is 2, then the other must be $-\\frac{4}{5}-2=\\boxed{-\\frac{14}{5}}$."
