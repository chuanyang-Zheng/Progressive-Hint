    "problem": "When Lauren was born on January 1, 1990, her grandparents put $\\$1000$ in a savings account in her name. The account earned $7.5\\%$ annual interest compounded quarterly every three months. To the nearest dollar, how much money was in her account when she turned two?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The annual interest rate is 7.5 percent, so each quarter, the investment is compounded at the rate of $7.5/4 = 1.875$ percent.  In two years, there are eight quarters, so the investment will have grown to $1000 \\cdot 1.01875^8 = \\boxed{1160}$, to the nearest dollar."
