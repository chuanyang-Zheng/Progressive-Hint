    "problem": "For how many positive integer values of $x$ is $x^{-1}>x$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Suppose $x$ is positive and satisfies $x^{-1}>x$. Because $x$ is positive, we can multiply both sides of the inequality by $x$ to obtain $1 > x^2$, an inequality which is clearly false for all positive integers $x$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{0}$ positive integer solutions."
