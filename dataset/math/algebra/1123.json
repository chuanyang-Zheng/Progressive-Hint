    "problem": "What is the domain of the function $$k(y) = \\frac{1}{2y+1}~?$$ Express your answer in interval notation.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The fraction $\\frac{1}{2y+1}$ fails to be defined only if the denominator is zero. This occurs when $y$ is the solution of the equation $$2y+1=0,$$ which is $y=-\\frac 12$. Thus the domain of $k(y)$ is $$\\boxed{\\left(-\\infty,-\\frac 12\\right)\\cup \\left(-\\frac 12,\\infty\\right)}.$$"
