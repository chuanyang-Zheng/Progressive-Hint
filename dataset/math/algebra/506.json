    "problem": "Eric's sports car's specifications include a $500$ metric horsepower engine. Eric wants to know how many kilowatts of power his car's engine can generate. What result should Eric obtain if $1$ kilowatt is equivalent to $1.36$ horsepower? (You may use a calculator on this problem; answer to the nearest kilowatt.)",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We multiply the engine's power measured in horsepower, $500$, by the conversion factor $\\frac{1\\ \\text{kW}}{1.36\\ \\text{hp}}$ to obtain $500\\ \\text{hp} \\cdot \\frac{1\\ \\text{kW}}{1.36\\ \\text{hp}} \\approx \\boxed{368}\\ \\text{kW}$."
