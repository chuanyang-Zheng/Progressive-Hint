    "problem": "Sally has a bagful of candy. She arranges it into an $a$ by $b$ grid, but she has $2a+b$ candies leftover. Her big sister Rita comes along and says, \"I can do better than that!\" Rita neatly arranges the candies into a $5a-4$ by $\\frac{b-1}{3}$ grid and has none leftover. What is the maximum number of candies in Sally's bag?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "In Sally's arrangement, the number of candies is $ab+2a+b$. In Rita's arrangement, the number of candies is $\\left(5a-4\\right)\\left(\\frac{b-1}{3}\\right)$. The number of candies didn't change, so these two expressions are equal.  Therefore,  \\begin{align*}\nab+2a+b&=(5a-4)\\left(\\frac{b-1}{3}\\right) \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n3ab+6a+3b&=(5a-4)(b-1)\\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n3ab+6a+3b&=5ab-4b-5a+4\\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n0&=2ab-7b-11a+4\\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n-4&=b(2a-7)-11a\\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n-4+\\frac{11}{2}(7)&=b(2a-7)-\\frac{11}{2}(2a-7)\\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n\\frac{-8}{2}+\\frac{77}{2}&=\\left(b-\\frac{11}{2}\\right)(2a-7)\\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n69&=(2b-11)(2a-7).\n\\end{align*}The prime factorization of $69$ is $3\\cdot 23$. So we have the following possibilities. \\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c}\n$2a-7$&$2b-11$&$2a$&$2b$&$a$&$b$\\\\ \\hline\n$1$&$69$&$8$&$80$&$4$&$40$\\\\\n$3$&$23$&$10$&$34$&$5$&$17$\\\\\n$23$&$3$&$30$&$14$&$15$&$7$\\\\\n$69$&$1$&$76$&$12$&$38$&$6$\n\\end{tabular}We know from above, since Rita's arrangement must have integral dimensions, that $b-1$ is divisible by $3$. A check shows that the pairs $(a,b)$ that don't work are $(5,17)$ and $(38,6)$. Thus we have either $(a,b)=(15,7)$ or $(a,b)=(4,40)$. There are $ab+2a+b$ candies. In this first case we have $(15)(7)+2(15)+7=142$ candies. In the second case there are $(4)(40)+2(4)+40=208$ candies. Thus the maximum number of candies that could be in Sally's bag is $\\boxed{208}$."
