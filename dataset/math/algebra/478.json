    "problem": "The volume of a cone is given by the formula $V = \\frac{1}{3}Bh$, where $B$ is the area of the base and $h$ is the height. The area of the base of a cone is 30 square units, and its height is 6.5 units. What is the number of cubic units in its volume?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We are given that $B = 30$ and $h = 6.5$ and asked to find $\\frac{1}{3}Bh$.  We find that \\[\\frac{1}{3}Bh = \\frac{1}{3}(30)(6.5) = (10)(6.5) = \\boxed{65}.\\]"
