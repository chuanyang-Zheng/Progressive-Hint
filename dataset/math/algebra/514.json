    "problem": "The expression $2z^2+13z+21$ can be written as $(z + a)(2z + b),$ where $a$ and $b$ are integers. What is $2a + b$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We see that $2z^2 + 13z + 21 = (z + 3)(2z + 7)$, thus $a = 3$ and $b = 7$. Hence, $2a + b = \\boxed{13}.$"
