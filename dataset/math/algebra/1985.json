    "problem": "My usual workout consists of running 10 laps around a 400 meter track. If I go to a track that is only 250 meters long, how many laps will I need to run to get the same workout?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since the total distance that I run is constant, the length of each lap and the total number of laps are inversely proportional. Consequently, if each lap is $\\frac{250}{400}=\\frac{5}{8}$ as long, I need to run $\\frac{8}{5}$ as many laps, so our answer is $\\frac{8}{5}\\cdot10=\\boxed{16}$ laps."
