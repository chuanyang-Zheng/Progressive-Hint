    "problem": "If $A=\\frac{1}{4}$ and $B=-\\frac{1}{2}$, what is the absolute value of the difference between $18A$ and $18B$? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We are looking for $|18A-18B|$, which we can rewrite as $|18(A-B)|=18|A-B|$.  Since $A-B=\\frac{1}{4}-\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)=\\frac{3}{4}$, we find $18|A-B|=18\\cdot\\frac{3}{4}=\\frac{27}{2}=\\boxed{13.5}$."
