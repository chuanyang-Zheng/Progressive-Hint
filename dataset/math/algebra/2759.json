    "problem": "Two identical blue boxes together weigh the same as three identical red boxes together. Each red box weighs 15.2 ounces. How much does one blue box weigh in ounces?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since one red box weighs 15.2 ounces, three red boxes weigh 45.6 ounces.  This is the same as two blue boxes, so  we have the equation $2b=45.6$ where $b$ represents the weight of the blue box. Solving the equation by multiplying both sides by $\\frac{1}{2}$ to isolate $b$ gives us $b=\\boxed{22.8}$ ounces."
