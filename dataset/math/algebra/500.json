    "problem": "What is the sum of the coordinates of the midpoint of the line segment connecting points $(5,4)$ and $(-9,8)$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The midpoint is $\\left(\\frac{5-9}{2},\\frac{4+8}{2}\\right)$. Therefore, the sum of its coordinates is $\\frac{5-9+4+8}{2} = \\frac{8}{2} = \\boxed{4}$."
