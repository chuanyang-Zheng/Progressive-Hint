    "solution": "Setting $x = 0,$ we get $f(0) = 9.$ Since $9 > 3,$ $f(9) = 9a + b.$ Hence, $$f(f(0)) = f(9) = 9a + b.$$But $f(f(x)) = x$ for all $x,$ so $9a + b = 0.$\n\nSetting $x = 1,$ we get $f(1) = 7.$ Since $7 > 3,$ $f(7) = 7a + b.$ Hence, $$f(f(1)) = f(7) = 7a + b.$$But $f(f(x)) = x$ for all $x,$ so $7a + b = 1.$\n\nSubtracting the equations $9a + b = 0$ and $7a + b = 1,$ we get $2a = -1,$ so $a = -1/2.$ From $9a + b = 0,$ we get $b = -9a = 9/2.$ Hence, $$a + b = -1/2 + (9/2) = \\boxed{4}.$$"
