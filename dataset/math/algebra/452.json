    "problem": "The first and ninth terms of an arithmetic sequence are $\\frac23$ and $\\frac45$, respectively. What is the fifth term?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since the fifth term is halfway between the first term and ninth term, it is simply the average of these terms, or \\[\\frac{2/3 + 4/5}{2} = \\boxed{\\frac{11}{15}}.\\]"
