    "problem": "The expression $6y^2-y-51$ can be rewritten as $(3Ay+B)(y-C)$, where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are positive integers. Find $(AC)^2-B$.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The expression $6y^2-y-51$ can be rewritten as $(6y+17)(y-3)$. Therefore, $A=2$, $B=17$, and $C=3$. Thus, $(AC)^2-B=(2\\times3)^2-17=\\boxed{19}$."
