    "problem": "The two lines $y = 2x - 13$ and $3x+y = 92$ intersect. What is the value of $x$ at the point of intersection?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "At the intersection of two lines, the $x$'s are equal and the $y$'s are equal. We may set $2x - 13 = 92 - 3x$ to find an $x$, where the $y$'s are equal.\n\n\\begin{align*}\n2x - 13 &= 92 - 3x \\\\\n5x &= 105 \\\\\nx &= \\boxed{21}\n\\end{align*}"
