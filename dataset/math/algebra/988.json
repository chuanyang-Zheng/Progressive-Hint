    "problem": "Solve the following equation for $x$: \\[ \\ \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{4}{x-5}.\\]",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Multiplying both sides by $x-5$ and by 3 gives $2(x-5) = 4(3)$.  Expanding the left side gives $2x-10 = 12$.  Adding 10 to both sides gives $2x = 22$ and dividing by 2 gives $x = \\boxed{11}$."
