    "problem": "At her track meet, Alice ran at a speed of $9\\ \\text{m/s}$ for $12$ seconds. How many meters did she run?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Letting $v$ denote speed, $x$ denote distance, and $t$ denote time, we have $v=\\frac{x}{t}$. In our problem, we're given that $v=9\\ \\text{m/s}$ and $t=12\\ \\text{s}$. Solving for the distance, we find that $x=vt=\\boxed{108}\\ \\text{m}$."
