    "problem": "A set of four consecutive integers has a sum of 22. If each integer of the set is increased by 2 and then multiplied by 20, what is the sum of the new set of integers?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Increasing each integer by 2 will increase their sum by $2\\cdot 4 = 8$, meaning the sum after this step is $22 + 8 = 30$.  Multiplying each integer by 20 will multiply the entire sum by 20, leading to a final sum of $30\\cdot 20 = \\boxed{600}$."
