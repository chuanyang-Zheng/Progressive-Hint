    "problem": "Find the product of all positive integer values of $c$ such that $3x^2+7x+c=0$ has two real roots.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "For a quadratic to have two real roots, the discriminant must be greater than 0. So we require \\begin{align*}7^2-4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot c &> 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\ 49-12c &>0\\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\ c&<\\frac{49}{12}.\\end{align*}The largest integer smaller than $\\frac{49}{12}$ is 4. Thus, the positive integer values of $c$ are 1, 2, 3, and 4, and their product is $\\boxed{24}$."
