    "problem": "Find the sum of all solutions to this equation: $x^2 + 6^2 = 10^2$.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We rearrange the terms to see that $x^2 = 64$. It follows that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, so the sum of all solutions is $\\boxed{0}$.\n\n- OR -\n\nThe equation should jump out as a 6-8-10 Pythagorean triple. Thus, $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and the sum of all solutions is $\\boxed{0}$, as before."
