    "problem": "A line segment has one endpoint at $(3,9)$ and midpoint at $(1,2)$. What is the sum of the coordinates of the other endpoint?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the other endpoint be $(x, y)$. We know that $\\frac{3 + x}{2} + \\frac{9 + y}{2} = 1 + 2 = 3$. Thus, $12 + x + y = 6$. It follows that $x + y = \\boxed{-6}$."
