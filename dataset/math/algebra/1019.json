    "problem": "What is the smallest value of $x$ such that $|5x - 1| = |3x + 2|$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "There are two cases, when $5x-1=3x+2$ and when $5x-1=-(3x+2).$ The two equations yield $x=\\frac{3}{2}$ and $x=-\\frac{1}{8},$ respectively, of which $x=\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{8}}$ is the smaller solution."
