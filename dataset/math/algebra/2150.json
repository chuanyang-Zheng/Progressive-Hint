    "problem": "Find the value of the expression. $$\\frac{7+8+9}{2+3+4}\\cdot\\frac{6+9+12}{9+8+7}$$",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Notice that there is a $7+8+9$ in the numerator and a $9+8+7$ in the denominator. Cancel these, leaving $\\frac{6+9+12}{2+3+4}$. At this point, simply perform the addition to get $\\frac{27}{9}$, which equals $\\boxed{3}$."
