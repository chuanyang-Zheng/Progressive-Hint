    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We know that the midpoint of a line segment with endpoints $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)$ is $$\\left(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\\right).$$The midpoint of the first segment is $$\\left(\\frac{2+0}{2}, \\frac{4+(-2)}{2}\\right) = (1,1),$$and the midpoint of the second segment is $$\\left(\\frac{5+1}{2}, \\frac{1+5}{2}\\right) = (3,3).$$The slope between these two points is $\\frac{3-1}{3-1} = \\boxed{1}.$"
