    "problem": "The ratio of teachers to students in a particular school is 1 to 11. The ratio of female students to the total number of students is 4 to 9. If there are 396 female students, how many teachers are there?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since female students make up $\\frac{4}{9}$ of the total student body, multiply 396 by $\\frac{9}{4}$ to find how many students there are total.  That yields 891 students total, and since there are 11 times as many students, divide 891 by 11 to obtain $\\boxed{81\\text{ teachers}}$ total."
