    "problem": "Find the distance between the vertex of the graph of the equation $f(x) = x^2 - 8x + 15$ and the point $(0, 2)$.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Completing the square, we get $f(x) = (x-4)^2 - 1$. The vertex of the graph of this equation is thus $(4, -1)$. Using the Pythagorean Theorem, it follows that the distance between $(0, 2)$ and $(4, -1)$ is $\\boxed{5}$."
