    "problem": "The parabola with equation $y=ax^2+bx+c$ and vertex $(h,k)$ is reflected about the line $y=k$. This results in the parabola with equation $y=dx^2+ex+f$. In terms of $k$, what is the value of $a+b+c+d+e+f$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We can rewrite the equation of the original parabola as $y=f(x)=a(x-h)^2+k$ (for some $a$). After reflection of the parabola, the equation becomes $y=g(x)=-a(x-h)^2+k$. Notice that $f(x)+g(x)=2k$. Since $f(1)=a+b+c$ and $g(1)=d+e+f$, we have $a+b+c+d+e+f=f(1)+g(1)=\\boxed{2k}$."
