    "problem": "Adina and Lynn are going rock-climbing and need to rent special shoes. Lynn is normally size 9 and knows that her rock-climbing shoe-size is 42. If Adina is normally size 6, what size rock-climbing shoes should she rent assuming shoe size is directly proportional to rock-climbing shoe size?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be Adina's rock-climbing size.  The ratio of the girl's shoe sizes must be constant: \\[\\frac{\\text{Lynn's size}}{\\text{Adina's size}} = \\frac{9}{6}=\\frac{42}{x},\\]so $9x=42\\cdot 6$, or $x=\\frac{42\\cdot 6}{9}=\\boxed{28}$."
