    "problem": "Evaluate $\\lceil\\sqrt{10}\\rceil+ \\lfloor\\sqrt{10}\\rfloor$.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since $\\sqrt{9}<\\sqrt{10}<\\sqrt{16}$, we know that $\\sqrt{10}$ is a number between $3$ and $4$. Therefore, the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to $\\sqrt{10}$ is $4$ and the greatest integer that is less than or equal to $\\sqrt{10}$ is $3$. So, $\\lceil\\sqrt{10}\\rceil+ \\lfloor\\sqrt{10}\\rfloor=4+3=\\boxed{7}$."
