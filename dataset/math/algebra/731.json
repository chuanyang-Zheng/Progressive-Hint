    "problem": "What is the product of the coordinates of the midpoint of a line segment with endpoints at $(1,1)$ and $(-7,5)$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We see that the midpoint has coordinates $\\left(\\frac{1 + (-7)}{2}, \\frac{1+5}{2}\\right) = (-3, 3)$.  Thus our desired answer is $-3\\cdot 3 = \\boxed{-9}$."
