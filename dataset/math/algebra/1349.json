    "solution": "Evelyn covered more distance in less time than Briana, Debra and Angela, so her average speed is greater than any of their average speeds. Evelyn went almost as far as Carla in less than half the time that it took Carla, so Evelyn's average speed is also greater than Carla's. Therefore, $\\boxed{\\text{Evelyn}}$ is our answer."
