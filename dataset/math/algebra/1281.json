    "problem": "A line parallel to $3x-7y = 65$ passes through the point $(7,4)$ and $(0,K)$. What is the value of K?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We put the equation of the line into slope-intercept form by solving for $y$: $y=\\frac{65-3x}{-7}$. That means the slope of the line is $\\frac{3}{7}$, and the slope of a parallel line must also be $\\frac{3}{7}$. The slope of the line through $(7,4)$ and $(0,K)$ is $\\frac{4-K}{7-0}$, which we set equal to $\\frac{3}{7}$ and solve for $K$. $$\\frac{4-K}{7}=\\frac{3}{7}\\qquad\\Rightarrow 4-K=3 \\qquad\\Rightarrow 1=K$$ So the value of K is $\\boxed{1}$."
