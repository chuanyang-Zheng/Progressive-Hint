    "problem": "What is the slope of a line perpendicular to the line containing the points $(-1,2)$ and $(1,-2)$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The slope of the line containing $(-1, 2)$ and $(1, -2)$ is $\\frac{2 - (-2)}{(-1) - 1} = -2$.  Since the other line is perpendicular to this one its slope is the negative reciprocal of $-2$ giving $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$."
