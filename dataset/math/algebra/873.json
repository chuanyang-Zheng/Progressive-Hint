    "problem": "For what value of $c$ will the circle with equation $x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0$ have a radius of length 1?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Completing the square gives us $(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c$. Since we want the radius to be 1, we must have $34 - c = 1^2$. It follows that $c = \\boxed{33}$."
