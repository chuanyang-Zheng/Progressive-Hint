    "problem": "The points $(7, -6)$ and $(-3, -4)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of a circle. What is the sum of the coordinates of the center of the circle?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The midpoint of a circle's diameter is its center. Thus, the center of the circle is at $\\left(\\frac{7+(-3)}{2},\\frac{-6+(-4)}{2}\\right)=(2,-5)$. The sum of the coordinates of this point is $2+(-5)=\\boxed{-3}$."
