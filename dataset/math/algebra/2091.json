    "problem": "You have a square that has a side length of $1$ centimeter. Each minute, $2$ centimeters are added to the side length. After $10$ minutes, what will be the difference between the area of the last square and the area of the initial square in square centimeters (do not include the units in your answer)?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The initial square has area $1^2 = 1\\text{ cm}^2$. After ten minutes, the side length of the square will be $1 + 2\\cdot 10 = 21\\text{ cm}$. So, the last square has area $21^2 = 441\\text{ cm}^2$. So the difference in areas is $441 - 1 = \\boxed{440\\text{ cm}^2}$."
