    "problem": "A man nearing retirement wants to invest some money in a fund that compounds annually at a rate of 6 percent, so that in five years, he will have at least $\\$100,000$.  How much money must he invest now to make that happen?  (Give your answer to the nearest dollar.)",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the amount the man invests now, in dollars.  Then in five years, at a six percent annual interest rate, he will have $x \\cdot 1.06^5$ dollars.  Therefore, $x$ must be at least \\[\\frac{100000}{1.06^5} = \\boxed{74726},\\]to the nearest dollar."
