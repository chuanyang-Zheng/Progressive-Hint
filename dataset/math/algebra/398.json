    "problem": "On planet Larky, 7 ligs = 4 lags, and 9 lags = 20 lugs. How many ligs are equivalent to 80 lugs?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Multiply the second equation by 4 to find that 36 lags are equivalent to 80 lugs.  Then multiply the first equation by 9 to find that 36 lags are equivalent to 63 ligs.  Since each is equivalent to 36 lags, 80 lugs and $\\boxed{63}$ ligs are equivalent."
