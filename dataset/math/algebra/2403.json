    "problem": "A population of bacteria is doubling every four hours. At noon there are $600$ bacteria. If this rate continues, how many bacteria will be present at midnight, twelve hours later?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Twelve hours later is three four-hour intervals later, so the population will double three times. The population size will be $600\\times2\\times2\\times2=600\\times2^3=\\boxed{4800}$ bacteria."
