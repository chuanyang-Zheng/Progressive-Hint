    "problem": "Each successive term in the sequence $243, 81, x,\ny, 3, \\ldots$ is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant. What is the value of $x + y$?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The common ratio $r$, is $\\frac{1}{3}$ (You can find this by dividing 81 by 243).  Therefore, $ x = 27$, $y = 9$, and $x+y = \\boxed{36}$"
