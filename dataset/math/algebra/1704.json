    "problem": "If $\\frac 25 = \\frac A{60} = \\frac {60}B$, what is $A + B$?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The equations allow us to solve for both $A$ and $B$. Note that $A=60 \\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right) = 24$ and $B=\\frac{60}{\\frac{2}{5}} = \\frac{300}{2} = 150$, for a total of $24+150=\\boxed{174}$."
