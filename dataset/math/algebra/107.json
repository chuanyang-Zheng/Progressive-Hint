    "problem": "Find the radius of the circle with equation $x^2 + 8x + y^2 - 6y = 0$.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Completing the square gives us $(x +4)^2 + (y -3)^2 -25 = 0$. Rearranging terms, we have $(x +4)^2 + (y -3)^2 = 25$. It follows that the square of the radius is 25, so the radius must be $\\boxed{5}$."
