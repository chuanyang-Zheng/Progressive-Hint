    "solution": "We can rephrase the problem as the system of equations: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{a+2b}{2} &= 7\\\\\n\\frac{a+2c}{2} &= 8\n\\end{align*} Adding these gives: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{a+2b}{2}+\\frac{a+2c}{2} &= 7+8\\\\\n\\frac{2a+2b+2c}{2} &= 15\\\\\na+b+c &= 15\\\\\n\\frac{a+b+c}{3} &= \\frac{15}{3} = \\boxed{5}\n\\end{align*}"
