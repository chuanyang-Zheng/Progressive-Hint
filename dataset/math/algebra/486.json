    "problem": "If three flicks are equivalent to eight flecks, and six flocks are equivalent to four flecks, how many flocks are equivalent to $12$ flicks?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If three flicks are equivalent to eight flecks, then twelve flicks are equivalent to $4 \\cdot 8 = 32$ flecks. Also, $32$ flecks are equivalent to $(32\\ \\text{flecks}) \\cdot \\frac{6\\ \\text{flocks}}{4\\ \\text{flecks}} = 48\\ \\text{flocks}$. Thus, $\\boxed{48}$ flocks are equivalent to $12$ flicks."
