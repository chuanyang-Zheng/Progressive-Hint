    "problem": "The expression $6x^2 + 17x + 5$ can be written in the form $(Ax+1)(Bx+5)$ where $A$ and $B$ are integers. What is the value of $AB$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We see that $6x^2 + 17x + 5$ can be rewritten as $(3x + 1)(2x + 5)$. Thus, $A = 3$ and $B = 2$ so $AB = 3 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{6}$."
