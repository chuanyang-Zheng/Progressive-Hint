    "problem": "To calculate $42^2$, Emily mentally figures the value $40^2$ and adds $164$. Emily subtracts a number from $40^2$ to calculate $38^2$. What number does she subtract?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We see that $38^2 = (40 - 2)^2 = 40^2 - 4\\cdot 40 +4 = 40^2 - 156$. Therefore, Emily subtracts $\\boxed{156}$."
