    "problem": "If $f(x)=\\dfrac{2}{x+1}$, then what is the value of $f^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "$f^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)$ is defined as the number $x$ such that $f(x)=\\frac{1}{5}$. Thus, we solve the equation $$\\frac{2}{x+1} = \\frac{1}{5}.$$Multiplying both sides by $5(x+1)$, we have $$10 = x+1.$$Subtracting $1$ from both sides gives $x=\\boxed{9}$."
