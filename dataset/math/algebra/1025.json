    "problem": "The two endpoints of a segment are at $(1,4)$ and $(1,10)$. What is the sum of the coordinates of the midpoint of the segment?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The midpoint of the segment is at $\\left(\\frac{1+1}{2},\\frac{4+10}{2}\\right)=(1,7)$, so the sum of the coordinates is $1+7=\\boxed{8}$."
