    "problem": "A point $(x,y)$ on the coordinate plane with both coordinates negative is a distance of 6 units from the $x$-axis. It is a distance of 15 units from the point $(8,3)$. It is a distance $\\sqrt{n}$ from the origin. What is $n$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We know that $y=-6$ from the given information. By the distance formula, we have the equation $\\sqrt{(x-8)^2+(-6-3)^2}=15$. Solving, we have \\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{(x-8)^2+(-6-3)^2}&=15 \\\\\nx^2-16x+64+81&=225 \\\\\nx^2-16x-80&=0 \\\\\n(x-20)(x+4)&=0\n\\end{align*}Thus, $x+4=0$ or $x-20=0$, so $x=-4$ or $x=20$. $x=-4$ by the given conditions. Thus, our point is $(-4,-6)$ and is a distance of $\\sqrt{(-4)^2+(-6)^2}=\\sqrt{52}$ units from the origin. $n=\\boxed{52}$."
