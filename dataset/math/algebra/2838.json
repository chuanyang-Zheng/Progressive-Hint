    "problem": "The expression $3x^2 + 14x + 8$ can be written in the form $(3x + A)(x + B)$ where $A$ and $B$ are integers. What is the value of $A - B$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We see that $3x^2 + 14x + 8$ can be rewritten as $(3x + 2)(x + 4)$. Thus, $A = 2$ and $B = 4$. We can then find $A - B = 2 - 4 = \\boxed{-2}$."
