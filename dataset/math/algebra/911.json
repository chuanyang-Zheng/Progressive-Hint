    "problem": "If $y = x^2 - 7$ and $x$ is a real number, then what is the minimum value possible for $y$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The minimum value of $x^2$ is 0, which occurs when $x=0$.  Therefore, the minimum possible value of $y=x^2-7$ is $\\boxed{-7}$, which occurs when $x=0$."
