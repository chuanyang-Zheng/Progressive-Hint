    "problem": "If $(2x+5)(x-3)=14$, find the sum of the possible values of $x$.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Expanding the left side of the given equation, we have $2x^2-x-15=14 \\Rightarrow 2x^2-x-29=0$. Since in a quadratic with equation of the form $ax^2+bx+c=0$ the sum of the roots is $-b/a$, the sum of the roots of the given equation is $1/2=\\boxed{.5}$."
