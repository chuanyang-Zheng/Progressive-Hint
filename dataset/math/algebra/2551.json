    "problem": "One ticket to a show costs $\\$20$ at full price. Susan buys $4$ tickets using a coupon that gives her a $25\\%$ discount. Pam buys $5$ tickets using a coupon that gives her a $30\\%$ discount. How many more dollars does Pam pay than Susan?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We need to calculate the total purchase price that Susan paid and that Pam paid.\n\nSusan bought $4$ tickets with $25\\%$ discount: $$4 \\times \\$20 = \\$80.$$With a $25$ percent discount, she paid $\\$80 * .75 = \\$60.$\n\nPam bought $5$ tickets with a $30\\%$ discount: $$5 \\times \\$20 = \\$100$$With a $30$ percent discount, she paid $\\$100 * .70 = \\$70.$\n\nThus Pam paid $\\$70 - \\$60 = \\$\\boxed{10}$ more than Susan."
