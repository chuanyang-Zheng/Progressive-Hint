    "problem": "The solutions to the equation $(x+1)(x+2) = x+3$ can be written in the form $m+\\sqrt n$ and $m-\\sqrt n$, where $m$ and $n$ are integers. What is $m+n$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "First, we expand the left side of our equation to get $$x^2+3x+2 = x+3.$$Then we subtract $x+3$ from both sides to get a quadratic equation in standard form: $$x^2+2x-1 = 0.$$This doesn't factor in an obvious way, so we apply the quadratic formula, which gives solutions of $$x = \\frac{-(2) \\pm\\sqrt{(2)^2 - 4(1)(-1)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{-2\\pm\\sqrt{8}}{2}.$$We can simplify this, dividing $2$ out of the numerator and denominator to obtain $$x = -1\\pm\\sqrt{2}.$$Thus, the integers $m$ and $n$ referred to in the problem are $m=-1$, $n=2$, and their sum is $-1+2=\\boxed{1}$."
