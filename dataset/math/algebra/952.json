    "problem": "What is the ordered pair of real numbers $(x, y)$ which satisfies the equation $|x+ y-7|+ |4x - y+ 12|= 0$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since the absolute value of a number is always nonnegative, we must have that $x + y - 7 = 0$ and $4x - y + 12 = 0$.  Adding these equations together, we find $x = -1$.  Thus $y = 8$, and the desired answer is $\\boxed{(-1,8)}$."
