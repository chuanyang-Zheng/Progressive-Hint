    "problem": "Anna, Bertram, Carli, and David have a competition to see which of them can hold their breath for the longest time period, in minutes. If Bertram, Carli, and David add their times together, the resulting sum is three times the length of time that Anna can hold her breath. Similarly, if Anna, Carli, and David sum their times, the result is four times Bertram's time period, and if Anna, Bertram, and David sum their times, the result is twice Carli's time. Finally, eight times Anna's time plus ten times Bertram's time plus six times Carli's time equals two fifths of an hour. If the length of time that David can hold his breath is expressed in minutes as a simplified fraction, what is the sum of the numerator and the denominator?",

    "solution": "Let $a$ denote the length of time, in minutes, that Anna holds her breath, $b$ denote the time that Bertram holds his breath, $c$ denote the time that Carli holds her breath, and $d$ denote the time that David holds his breath. Using the information in the problem, we can form the following system of linear equations (note that $\\frac{2}{5}$ of an hour is the same as $24$ minutes):  \\begin{align*}\n3a &= b + c + d \\\\\n4b &= a + c + d \\\\\n2c &= a + b + d \\\\\n8a + 10b + 6c &= 24\n\\end{align*} Subtracting the third equation from the first gives $3a - 2c = c - a$, which simplifies to $4a = 3c$. Subtracting the third equation from the second gives $4b - 2c = c - b$, so $5b = 3c$. We thus have that $4a = 5b = 3c$. Call this value $x$. Substituting $x$ for $4a$, $5b$, and $3c$ in the fourth equation gives $6x = 24$, so $x = 4$. Therefore, $a = \\frac{4}{4} = 1$, $b = \\frac{4}{5}$, and $c = \\frac{4}{3}$. Substituting these values into the first equation yields $3 = \\frac{4}{5} + \\frac{4}{3} + d$, so $d = \\frac{13}{15}$. Finally, the problem asks for the sum of the numerator and the denominator, so our answer is $\\boxed{28}$."
