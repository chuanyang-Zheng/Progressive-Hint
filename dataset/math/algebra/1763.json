    "problem": "Raymond normally has a snack consisting of ten 12-calorie crackers. How many 20-calorie cookies would he have to eat to consume the same number of calories?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Raymond consumes a total of $10\\cdot12=120$ calories at snack. If he eats $c$ cookies, he would get $20c$ calories, so since he needs this to equal 120, he must eat $c=120/20=\\boxed{6}$ cookies."
