    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The sum of $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ is $\\frac{3}{6}+\\frac{2}{6}=\\frac{5}{6}$, and their product is $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{3}=\\frac{1}{6}$.  The positive difference between $\\frac{5}{6}$ and $\\frac{1}{6}$ is $\\frac{4}{6}=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$."
