    "problem": "Let $a$ be the smallest integer satisfying the inequality $x^2 - 15 < 2x$, and let $b$ be the largest integer satisfying the same inequality. What is $b-a$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Subtracting $2x$ from both sides, it follows that $x^2 - 2x - 15 < 0$. This factors as $x^2 - 2x - 15 = (x-5)(x+3) < 0$, from which it follows (by testing values or inspection) that $-3 < x < 5$. Then $a = -2, b = 4$, and $b-a$ is $4 - (-2) = \\boxed{6}$."
