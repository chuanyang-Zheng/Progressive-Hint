    "problem": "Find all values of $r$ such that $5^{2r-3} = 25$.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We write both sides with the same base, 5.  This gives us $5^{2r-3} = 5^2$.  Since the bases of both sides are the same, the exponents must be equal.  Therefore, we have $2r-3=2$, so $r=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{2}}$."
