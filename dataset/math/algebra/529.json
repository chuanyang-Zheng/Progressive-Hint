    "problem": "The sum of 27 consecutive positive integers is $3^7$. What is their median?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The median of a set of consecutive positive integers is equal to the mean of the set of integers.  Therefore, we can find the median by dividing the sum by the number of integers: $3^7/3^3=3^4=\\boxed{81}$."
