    "problem": "An infinite geometric series has common ratio $-1/2$ and sum 45.  What is the first term of the series?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the first term be $a$.  Because the sum of the series is 45, we have $45= a/[1-(-1/2)] = a/(3/2) = 2a/3$.  Therefore, $a=\\boxed{\\frac{135}{2}}$."
