    "problem": "If $70 + m + n - 20 = 80$ and $m = 2n$, then what is the value of $n$?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Substituting $m=2n$ into the first equation gives $70 + 2n + n - 20 = 80$.  Simplifying the left side gives $3n +50 = 80$.  Subtracting 50 from both sides gives $3n = 30$, so $n = \\boxed{10}$."
