    "problem": "If $j$ and $k$ are inversely proportional and $j = 42$ when $k = 56$, what is the value of $j$ when $k = 32$? Express your answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest tenth.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "By the definition of inverse proportion, the product $jk$ is always equal to some constant $C$.  Substituting the given values, we can see that $42\\cdot 56= 2352=C$.  Using this $C$ value, we can solve for $j$ when $k=32$: \\begin{align*}\nj\\cdot 32&=2352\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad j&=\\frac{2352}{32}=\\boxed{73.5}\n\\end{align*}"
