    "problem": "If $2x - 9y = 14$ and $6x = 42 +y$, what is the value of the product $xy$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Multiplying the first equation by 3, we find that $6x - 27y = 42$, or $6x = 42 + 27y$.  But also $6x = 42 + y$.  Thus we see immediately that $27y = y$, or $y=0$.  Therefore $xy = \\boxed{0}$."
