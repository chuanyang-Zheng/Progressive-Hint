    "problem": "The product of two positive integers minus their sum is 39. The integers are relatively prime, and each is less than 20. What is the sum of the two integers?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let our positive integers be $a$ and $b.$ It follows that\n\n\\[ab - (a + b) = ab - a - b = 39.\\]The left-hand side reminds us of Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick. So, we add $1$ to both sides to \"complete the rectangle\":\n\n\\[ab - a - b + 1 = 39 + 1 \\implies (a - 1)(b - 1) = 40.\\]We can narrow down the possibilities by considering all the positive factor pairs of $40$. We disregard values of $a$ and $b$ that are not relatively prime positive integers both less than $20$.\n\n\\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c}\n$a-1$ & $b-1$ & $a$ & $b$ & Feasible? \\\\\n\\hline\n$1$ & $40$ & $2$ & $41$ & $\\times$ \\\\\n\\hline\n$2$ & $20$ & $3$ & $21$ & $\\times$ \\\\\n\\hline\n$4$ & $10$ & $5$ & $11$ & $\\checkmark$ \\\\\n\\hline\n$5$ & $8$ & $6$ & $9$ & $\\times$\n\\end{tabular}The only possibility that works is $a = 5$ and $b = 11$, or, by symmetry, $a = 11$ and $b = 5$. Either way, the sum $a + b$ is equal to $\\boxed{16}$."
