    "problem": "Jasmine drank 1.5 pints of water on the first 3 miles of her hike. If she continued at this rate, how many pints of water would she drink in the next 10 miles?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We can set up the ratios $\\frac{1.5}{3}=\\frac{x}{10}$, where $x$ is how many pints of water she'd drink in the next 10 miles. We cross-multiply to get $3x=1.5(10)=15$, which means $x=5$. Jasmine would drink $\\boxed{5}$ pints of water in the next 10 miles."
