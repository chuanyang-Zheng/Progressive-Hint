    "solution": "Using the midpoint formula, we find that the midpoint of $s_1$ has coordinates $\\left(\\frac{3+\\sqrt{2}+4}{2},\\frac{5+7}{2}\\right)=\\left(\\frac{7+\\sqrt{2}}{2}, 6\\right)$.\n\nThe midpoint of $s_2$ has coordinates $\\left(\\frac{6-\\sqrt{2}+3}{2},\\frac{3+5}{2}\\right)=\\left(\\frac{9-\\sqrt{2}}{2}, 4\\right)$.\n\nApplying the formula once more we see that the desired point is at $\\left(\\dfrac{\\dfrac{7+\\sqrt{2}+9-\\sqrt{2}}{2}}{2},\\frac{4+6}{2}\\right)=\\boxed{(4,5)}.$"
