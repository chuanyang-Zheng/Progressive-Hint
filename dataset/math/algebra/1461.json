    "problem": "Given that $M( 1, -6)$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$ and $A(-2, 1)$ is one endpoint, what is the sum of the coordinates of point $B$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Call the coordinates of point $B$ $(x,y)$. The coordinates of a midpoint are the average of the coordinates of the two endpoints, so we know that $\\frac{-2+x}{2} = 1$ and $\\frac{1+y}{2} = -6$. Solving for $x$ and $y$ gives $x = 4$ and $y = -13$. We take the sum of $x$ and $y$ for an answer of $\\boxed{-9}$."
