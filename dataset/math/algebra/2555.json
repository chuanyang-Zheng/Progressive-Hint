    "problem": "What is the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept of the line that passes through the point $(2,-3)$ and has slope $\\frac12$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "A point-slope form of the equation is \\[y - (-3) = \\frac{1}{2}(x-2).\\]Multiplying both sides by 2 gives $2(y+3) = x-2$, and rearranging this gives $x - 2y =8$.  Letting $x=0$ and solving for $y$ gives us the desired $y$-coordinate of $\\boxed{-4}$."
