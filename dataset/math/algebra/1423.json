    "problem": "A triangle is formed with edges along the line $y=\\frac{2}{3}x+5$, the $x$-axis, and the line $x=k$. If the area of the triangle is less than $20$, find the sum of all possible integral values of $k$.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since two of the lines that are the edges of the triangle are known, their intersection must be one of the vertices of the triangle. So we have $y=0$ (the $x$-axis) and $y=\\frac{2}{3}x+5$. Solving this equation, we find $0=\\frac{2}{3}x+5$, or $-5=\\frac{2}{3}x$, so $x=-\\frac{15}{2}$. Thus one of the vertices of the triangle is $\\left(-\\frac{15}{2},0\\right)$. The other vertices lie on the line $x=k$, so they take the form $(k,0)$ and $\\left(k,\\frac{2}{3}k+5\\right)$. The area of the triangle can be expressed as $\\frac{1}{2}bh$. The height is $\\frac{2}{3}k+5$, since the base is along the $x$-axis, and the base is $k-\\left(-\\frac{15}{2}\\right)=k+\\frac{15}{2}$. Thus the area is $\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{2}{3}k+5\\right)\\left(k+\\frac{15}{2}\\right)$.\n\nUp until this point we've mostly ignored the possibility of having a triangle below the $x$-axis, with $k<-\\frac{15}{2}$. This is possible, but our formula for the area will still work. If $k<-\\frac{15}{2}$, then $k+\\frac{15}{2}$ will be negative. But the line $y=\\frac{2}{3}x+5$ will be below the $x$-axis so the value $\\frac{2}{3}k+5$ will be negative as well. Half their product, the area, will thus be positive as desired. So we have  \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{2}{3}k+5\\right)\\left(k+\\frac{15}{2}\\right)&<20\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n\\left(\\frac{2}{3}k+5\\right)\\left(k+\\frac{15}{2}\\right)&<40\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n\\frac{2}{3}k^2+10k+\\frac{75}{2}&<40\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n\\frac{2}{3}k^2+10k-\\frac{5}{2}&<0\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n4k^2+60k-15&<0.\n\\end{align*}We must solve this quadratic inequality. The roots of the quadratic are $$\\frac{-(60)\\pm\\sqrt{(60)^2-4(4)(-15)}}{2(4)}=\\frac{-60\\pm\\sqrt{3840}}{8}=-\\frac{15}{2}\\pm2\\sqrt{15}.$$Testing, we find that the value of the quadratic is negative between the roots, or $4k^2+60k-15<0$ whenever $-\\frac{15}{2}-2\\sqrt{15}<k<-\\frac{15}{2}+2\\sqrt{15}$. The decimal approximations of the roots are $-15.25\\ldots$ and $0.25\\ldots$, respectively, so we have $-15.25<k<0.25$. Since we are interested in values of $k$ for which $k$ is an integer, we have $-15\\le k\\le 0$. The problem asks for the sum of all integral values of $k$, so we must sum the integers from $-15$ to $0$. We can compute this with the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: $S=\\frac{(-15+0)(16)}{2}=\\boxed{-120}$."
