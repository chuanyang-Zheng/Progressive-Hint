    "problem": "Suppose a function $f(x)$ has domain $(-\\infty,\\infty)$ and range $[-11,3]$. If we define a new function $g(x)$ by $$g(x) = f(6x)+1,$$ then what is the range of $g(x)$? Express your answer in interval notation.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "First, note that $f(x)$ and $f(6x)$ have the same range, because every value assumed by $f(x)$ (at, say, $x=a$) is also assumed by $f(6x)$ (at $x=\\frac a6$), and vice versa.\n\nSince $g(x)=f(6x)+1$, its range is equal to the range of $f(6x)$ with all values increased by $1$. Thus, the range of $g(x)$ is $[-11+1,3+1] = \\boxed{[-10,4]}$."
