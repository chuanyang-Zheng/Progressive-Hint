    "problem": "Given that $2x - 3y = 8$ and $4x + 3y = -2$, what is the product of $x$ and $y$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Adding the two equations gives $6x = 6$, so $x=1$.  Substituting this into the first equation gives $2 - 3y = 8$.  Solving for $y$ gives $y=-2$, so $xy = \\boxed{-2}$."
