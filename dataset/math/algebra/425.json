    "problem": "In the equation $|x-4| -10 = 2$, what is the product of all possible values of $x$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We rearrange the given equation to $|x-4| = 12$.  Thus either $x-4 = 12$, meaning $x = 16$, or $x-4 = -12$, meaning $x=-8$.  Our answer is therefore $16\\cdot (-8) = \\boxed{-128}$."
