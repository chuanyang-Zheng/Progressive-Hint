    "problem": "A lattice point is a point whose coordinates are both integers. How many lattice points are on the boundary or inside the region bounded by $y=|x|$ and $y=-x^2+\\frac{35}{4}$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The graph of the two equations is shown below:\n\n[asy]\nLabel f;\n\nf.p=fontsize(4);\n\nxaxis(-4,4,Ticks(f, 2.0));\n\nyaxis(-1,9,Ticks(f, 2.0));\n\nreal f(real x)\n\n{\n\nreturn abs(x);\n\n}\n\ndraw(graph(f,-4,4), linewidth(1));\nreal g(real x)\n\n{\n\nreturn -x^2+8.75;\n\n}\n\ndraw(graph(g,-3,3), linewidth(1));\n[/asy]\n\nWe first find the $x$ values at which the two equations intersect. When $x\\ge 0$, $y=|x|=x$. Plugging this into the second equation to eliminate $y$, we get $x=-x^2+\\frac{35}{4}\\Rightarrow x^2+x-\\frac{35}{4}=0$. Factoring the left hand side gives $\\left(x+\\frac{7}{2}\\right)\\left(x-\\frac{5}{2}\\right)=0$, so $x=2.5$ (since we stated that $x$ was non-negative). By symmetry, the $x$ value of the left intersection is $x=-2.5$. So we just have to consider the integer $x$ values between these two bounds and find all integer $y$ values that make the point $(x,y)$ fall inside the region.\n\nFor $x=-2$, the value of $y=|x|$ is $y=2$ and the value of $y=-x^2+\\frac{35}{4}$ is $y=\\frac{19}{4}=4.75$, so all $y$ values between 2 and 4 inclusive work, for a total of 3 points. For $x=-1$, the value of $y=|x|$ is $y=1$ and the value of $y=-x^2+\\frac{35}{4}$ is $y=\\frac{31}{4}=7.75$, so all $y$ values between 1 and 7 inclusive work, for a total of 7 points. For $x=0$, the value of $y=|x|$ is $y=0$ and the value of $y=-x^2+\\frac{35}{4}$ is $y=\\frac{35}{4}=8.75$, so all $y$ values between 0 and 8 inclusive work, for a total of 9 points. By symmetry, when $x=1$, there are 7 points that work, and when $x=2$, there are 3 points that work.\n\nIn total, there are $3+7+9+7+3=\\boxed{29}$ lattice points in the region or on the boundary."
