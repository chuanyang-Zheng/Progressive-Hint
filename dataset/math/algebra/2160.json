    "problem": "Monica, who is 5 feet tall, is standing next to a pine tree that casts a shadow 34 feet long. If Monica's shadow is 2 feet long, how tall is the pine tree, in feet?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Monica's shadow is $\\dfrac{2}{5}$ times as long as she is tall, so the pine tree's shadow is also $\\dfrac{2}{5}$ times as long as the tree is tall. Since the pine tree's shadow is 34 feet long, the pine tree itself is $34\\div \\dfrac{2}{5}=(34)\\left(\\dfrac{5}{2}\\right)=\\boxed{85\\text{ feet}}$ tall."
