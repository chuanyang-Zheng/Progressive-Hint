    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The numbers in the last row are $50,$ $49,$ $48,$ $47,$ $46,$ so we want to find the sum \\[5+6+15+16+\\dots+45+46.\\] The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms.\n\nWe first add $5+15+25+35+45$ by observing that the mean of these five terms is $25,$ so their sum is $25\\cdot5.$ Similarly, the mean of the five terms in the sum $6+16+26+36+46$ is $26,$ so their sum is $26\\cdot 5.$ Adding these sums, we find that the original sum is $$25\\cdot5+26\\cdot 5=(25+26)\\cdot5=51\\cdot5=\\boxed{255}.$$"
