    "problem": "The owners of the Luray Caverns in Virginia conduct tours every 20 minutes. Each day in April the first tour is at 9 a.m., and the last tour starts at 6 p.m. How many tours are there per day in April?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "From 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. there are 9 hours. In each hour, there are 3 tours (every 20 minutes). Thus, in 9 hours, there are $9 \\cdot 3 = 27$ tours. Don't forget to count the last tour at 6 p.m., so there are $\\boxed{28}$ tours total per day."
