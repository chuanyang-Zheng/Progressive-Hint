    "problem": "The sum of two numbers is 25 and their difference is 9. What is their product?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We can represent the given information with the following system of linear equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx + y &= 25, \\\\\nx - y &= 9.\n\\end{align*}To find the product of $x$ and $y$, solve for each independently.\n\nBegin by adding the two equations:  \\begin{align*}\n2x &= 34 \\\\\nx &= 17\n\\end{align*}Substituting in for $x$ yields a value of $8$ for $y$.\n\nHence, $x \\cdot y = 17 \\cdot 8 = \\boxed{136}$"
