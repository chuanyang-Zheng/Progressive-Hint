    "solution": "First, we simplify the denominator:  $$\\frac{2}{\\sqrt[3]{4}+\\sqrt[3]{32}}=$$$$\\frac{2}{\\sqrt[3]{4}+2\\sqrt[3]{4}}=$$$$\\frac{2}{3\\sqrt[3]{4}}$$Then, we multiply the denominator by something that would remove the cube root. Multiplying $\\sqrt[3]{4}$ by $\\sqrt[3]{2}$ would give $\\sqrt[3]{8}$, which is an integer, $2$. Therefore, we multiply the expression of $\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{2}}{\\sqrt[3]{2}}$. $$\\frac{2}{3\\sqrt[3]{4}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt[3]{2}}{\\sqrt[3]{2}}=$$$$\\frac{2\\sqrt[3]{2}}{6}=$$$$\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{2}}{3}$$Therefore, $A+B=2+3=\\boxed{5}$."
