    "problem": "There are two solutions for the equation $x^2 - x - 6 = 0$. What is the product of these two solutions?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "In a quadratic with the equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$, the product of the roots is $c/a$. Applying this formula to the problem, we have that the product of the two roots is $-6/1=\\boxed{-6}$."
