    "problem": "Two positive numbers $p$ and $q$ have the property that their sum is equal to their product. If their difference is $7$, what is $\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{p^2}+\\frac{1}{q^2}}$? Your answer will be of the form $\\frac{a+b\\sqrt{c}}{d}$, where $a$ and $b$ don't both share the same common factor with $d$ and $c$ has no square as a factor. Find $a+b+c+d$.",

    "solution": "Let $p+q=pq=s$. Then $(p+q)^2=p^2+q^2+2pq=s^2$. We subtract $4pq=4s$ from both sides to find $$p^2+q^2-2pq=(p-q)^2=s^2-4s.$$We are given that the difference between $p$ and $q$ is $7$, so $p-q=\\pm 7$, and $(p-q)^2=(\\pm 7)^2=49$, so our equation becomes $49=s^2-4s$ or $s^2-4s-49=0$. We can solve for $s$ using the quadratic formula:  \\begin{align*}\ns&=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\\\\\n&=\\frac{4\\pm\\sqrt{4^2-4(-49)(1)}}{2(1)}\\\\\n&=\\frac{4\\pm\\sqrt{4(4+49)}}{2}\\\\\n&=2\\pm\\sqrt{53}.\n\\end{align*}Since $p$ and $q$ are positive, we know $s=pq=p+q$ is positive, so we take the positive solution, $s=2+\\sqrt{53}$.\n\nNow we must find $\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{p^2}+\\frac{1}{q^2}}$. We can combine the fractions in the denominator by finding a common denominator: $$\\frac{1}{p^2}+\\frac{1}{q^2}=\\frac{1}{p^2}\\cdot\\frac{q^2}{q^2}+\\frac{1}{q^2}\\cdot\\frac{p^2}{p^2}=\\frac{q^2+p^2}{p^2q^2}.$$We know from above that $p^2+q^2=s^2-2pq=s^2-2s$, and $p^2q^2=(pq)^2=s^2$, so we must find \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{\\frac{s^2-2s}{s^2}}&=\\frac{s^2}{s^2-2s}\\\\\n&=\\frac{s}{s-2}\\\\\n&=\\frac{2+\\sqrt{53}}{2+\\sqrt{53}-2}\\\\\n&=\\frac{2+\\sqrt{53}}{\\sqrt{53}}.\n\\end{align*}Rationalizing the denominator gives $\\boxed{\\frac{2\\sqrt{53}+53}{53}}$. Thus in the form requested, $a=53$, $b=2$, $c=53$, and $d=53$, so \\begin{align*}\na+b+c+d&=53+2+53+53\\\\\n&=\\boxed{161}.\n\\end{align*}"
