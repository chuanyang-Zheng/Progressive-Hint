    "problem": "Factor the following expression: $7x^2-63$.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We can factor out a $7$ from both terms, giving $7(x^2-9)$. Then we can factor the second expression as a difference of squares, giving our answer of $\\boxed{7(x+3) (x-3)}$."
