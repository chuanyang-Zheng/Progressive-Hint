    "problem": "What is the sum of the coordinates of the midpoint of a line segment with endpoints at $(3,1)$ and $(5,1)$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since the midpoint of a segment has coordinates that are the average of the coordinates of the endpoints, we see that the midpoint has coordinates $\\left(\\frac{5+3}{2}, \\frac{1+1}{2}\\right) = (4,1)$.  Thus our desired answer is $4 + 1 = \\boxed{5}$."
