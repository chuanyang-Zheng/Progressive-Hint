    "problem": "If $x^2 + y = 4$ and $x^4 +y^2 = 10$, then what is $x^2y$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We square the first equation to get that $x^4 + 2x^2y + y^2 = 16$. Subtracting the second equation then gives us $2x^2y = 6$ from which it follows that $x^2y = \\boxed{3}$."
