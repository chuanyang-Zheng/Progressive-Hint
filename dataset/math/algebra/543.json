    "problem": "Vanessa will graph the lines $y = \\frac{1}{3}x + 7$ and $y = 2x+5$. What is the sum of the $x$-coordinates of the two lines' $x$-intercepts? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The $x$-intercept occurs where $y=0$.  For the first equation, setting $0 = \\frac{1}{3} x + 7$ yields $x = -21$.  For the second equation, setting $0 = 2x + 5$ yields $x = -2.5$.  Adding these together, our answer is $-21 + -2.5 = \\boxed{-23.5}$."
