    "problem": "The operation $\\&$ is defined for positive integers $a$ and $b$ as $a \\& b = \\displaystyle\\frac{\\sqrt{a b + a}}{\\sqrt{a b - b}}$. What is the value of $9 \\& 2$? Express your answer as a common fraction in simplest radical form.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We have $9\\&2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{(9)(2)+9}}{\\sqrt{(9)(2)-2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{27}}{\\sqrt{16}} = \\boxed{\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{4}}.$"
