    "problem": "A shop sells 500 smartphones a week for $\\$450$ each. A market survey shows that each decrease of $\\$5$ on the price will result in the sale of an additional 10 smartphones per week. What price of the smartphone would result in maximum revenue, in dollars?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Suppose the price of the cellphone is reduced to $450 - 5x$ dollars; then it will sell $500 + 10x$ units, so the revenue will be\n\\begin{align*}\n(450 - 5x)(500 + 10x) &= 5(90 - x) 10(50 + x) \\\\\n&= 50 (90 - x)(50 + x) \\\\\n&= 50 (-x^2  + 40x + 4500),\n\\end{align*}in dollars.\n\nCompleting the square on $-x^2 + 40x + 4500,$ we get\n\\begin{align*}\n50 (-x^2 + 40x + 4500) &= 50 (-(x - 20)^2 + 400 + 4500) \\\\\n&= 50 (-(x - 20)^2 + 4900) \\\\\n&= -50 (x - 20)^2 + 245000.\n\\end{align*}This is maximized when $x = 20,$ so the optimal price of the smartphone is $450 - 5(20) = \\boxed{350}$ dollars."
