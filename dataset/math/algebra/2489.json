    "problem": "Dr. Jones lives in a country with a progressive tax system. That is, he does not pay any taxes on the first $\\$20{,}000$ in income he makes, he pays $5\\%$ taxes on the next $\\$25{,}000$, he pays $10\\%$ taxes on the next $\\$35{,}000$, he pays $15\\%$ on the next $\\$50{,}000$, and he pays $20\\%$ on every additional dollar onwards. If Dr. Jones pays $\\$10{,}000$ in taxes, then how much income does he make?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If Dr. Jones has an income of $x$, then the amount of tax is essentially a piecewise function in $x$. In particular, if we let $t(x)$ denote the amount of taxes, then $t(x) = 0$ when $0 \\le x \\le 20000$. For $20000 \\le x \\le 45000$, he pays $$t(x) = 0.05 (x-20000).$$For $45000 \\le x \\le 80000$, he pays  \\begin{align*}\nt(x)& = 0.05(45000-20000) + 0.1(x - 45000)\\\\\n& = 1250 + x/10 - 4500.\n\\end{align*}For $80000 \\le x \\le 130000$ he pays  \\begin{align*}\nt(x) &= 1250 + 0.1(80000-45000) + 0.15(x - 80000)\\\\\n& = 4750 + 0.15x - 12000.\n\\end{align*}Finally, if $x \\ge 130000$, he pays  \\begin{align*}t(x) &= 4750 + 0.15(130000-80000) + 0.2(x - 130000)\\\\\n& = 12250 + 0.2(x - 130000).\\end{align*}We can immediately eliminate the last possibility, since then he would automatically pay at least $\\$12,250$ in taxes. If $x \\le 80000$, then $t(x) \\le 1250 + 80000/10 - 4500 = 4750$. Hence, $80000 \\le x \\le 130000$. Then, $$10000 = 4750 + 0.15x - 12000 \\Longrightarrow x = \\boxed{\\$115,000}.$$"
