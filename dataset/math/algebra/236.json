    "problem": "Suppose that $f$ is a polynomial such that \\[(x^2-1)\\cdot f(x)=5x^6-x^5+3x^4+x^3 - 25x^2 +38x -17.\\]What is the degree of $f$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since the product of $f$ and a polynomial with degree 2 equals a polynomial with degree 6, we know that $f$ is a polynomial with degree $6-2=\\boxed{4}$."
