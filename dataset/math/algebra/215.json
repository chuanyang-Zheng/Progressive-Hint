    "problem": "What is the sum of the two values of $x$ for which $(x+3)^2 = 121$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Expanding the left side, we have $x^2+6x+9=121 \\Rightarrow x^2+6x-112=0$. For a quadratic with the equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$, the sum of the roots is $-b/a$. Applying this formula to the problem, we have that the sum of the two roots is $-6/1=\\boxed{-6}$."
