    "problem": "Find the positive difference between the solutions to the equation $6t^2 + 30 = 41t$.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Rearranging the equation gives $6t^2 -41t + 30 = 0$.  Factoring gives $(t-6)(6t-5)= 0$, so the solutions to the equation are $t=6$ and $t=\\frac{5}{6}$.  The positive difference between these solutions is $6 - \\frac56 = \\boxed{\\frac{31}{6}}.$"
