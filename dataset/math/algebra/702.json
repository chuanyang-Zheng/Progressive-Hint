    "solution": "Replace a triangle with the letter $a$ and a circle with the letter $b.$ The two given equations become \\begin{align*}\n5a+3b&=21\\\\\n3a+5b&=16\n\\end{align*}Multiplying the first equation by $3,$ we get $15a+9b=63.$ Multiplying the second equation by $5,$ we get $15a+25b=80.$ Subtracting this last equation from the second-to-last equation to eliminate $a,$ we have $16b=17.$ Multiplying both sides by $\\frac{2}{16},$ we get $$\\frac{2}{16}\\cdot 16b = \\frac{2}{16} \\cdot 17 \\implies 2b=\\frac{17}{8}.$$Thus, two circles equals $\\boxed{\\frac{17}{8}}.$"
