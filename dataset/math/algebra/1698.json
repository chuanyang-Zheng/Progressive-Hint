    "problem": "The sum of five consecutive integers is five. What is the product of the five integers?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We let $a$ represent the first integer. That means the five consecutive integers are $a, a+1,\\cdots,a+4$. We let the sum equal 5 and solve for $a$. \\begin{align*}\na+(a+1)+(a+2)+(a+3)+(a+4)&=5\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n5a+10&=5\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n5a&=-5\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\na&=-1\n\\end{align*} The integers are -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, and the product is $\\boxed{0}$."
