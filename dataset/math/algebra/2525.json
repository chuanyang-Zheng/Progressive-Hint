    "problem": "A tennis player computes her win ratio by dividing the number of matches she has won by the total number of matches she has played. At the start of a weekend, her win ratio is exactly $.500$. During the weekend, she plays four matches, winning three and losing one. At the end of the weekend, her win ratio is greater than $.503$. What's the largest number of matches she could've won before the weekend began?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $n$ be the number of matches she won before the weekend began. Since her win ratio started at exactly .$500 = \\tfrac{1}{2},$ she must have played exactly $2n$ games total before the weekend began. After the weekend, she would have won $n+3$ games out of $2n+4$ total. Therefore, her win ratio would be $(n+3)/(2n+4).$ This means that \\[\\frac{n+3}{2n+4} > .503 = \\frac{503}{1000}.\\]Cross-multiplying, we get $1000(n+3) > 503(2n+4),$ which is equivalent to $n < \\frac{988}{6} = 164.\\overline{6}.$ Since $n$ must be an integer, the largest possible value for $n$ is $\\boxed{164}.$"
