    "problem": "Given that $-4$ is a solution to $x^2 + bx -36 = 0$, what is the value of $b$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The product of the roots of this quadratic is $-36/1=-36$, so the other solution must be $-36/-4=9$. That means that the sum of the solutions is $-4+9=5$. The sum of the solutions is also $-b/1=-b$. Thus, $-b=5$ and $b=\\boxed{-5}$."
