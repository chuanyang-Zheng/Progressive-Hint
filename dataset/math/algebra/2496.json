    "problem": "The sum of three consecutive integers is 27. What is the product of the integers?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $a$ be the middle integer, so the integers are $a-1$, $a$, and $a+1$. The sum of the the three integers is $(a-1) + a + (a+1) = 3a$, so $3a = 27$, or $a=9$. So the integers are 8, 9, and 10. Their product is $\\boxed{720}$."
