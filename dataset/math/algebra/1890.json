    "problem": "Let $P(x) = 4x^3 - 2x^2 + 7x - 1$, and let $Q(x) = P(x)^2$. What is the y-intercept of $Q(x)$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The y-intercept of a function is the value of the function when $x = 0$. Thus, we want to find the value of $Q(0) = P(0)^2$. Now, $P(0) = 4(0)^3-2(0)^2+7(0)-1=-1$, so it follows that $Q(0) = (-1)^2 = \\boxed{1}$."
