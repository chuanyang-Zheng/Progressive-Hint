    "problem": "What is the sum of the two values which will make the following expression undefined? $$\\frac{x-3}{2x^2-8x+7}$$",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The expression is undefined when the denominator is equal to 0. Thus, we want the sum of the solutions of the equation $2x^2-8x+7=0$. Since for a quadratic with equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$, the sum of the solutions is $-b/a$, the sum of the solutions of our equation is $-\\frac{-8}{2}=\\boxed{4}$."
