    "problem": "What is the range of the function $$f(x) = \\frac{1}{1-x}~?$$ Express your answer in interval notation.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Every real number can be expressed in the form $1-x$ for some real $x$, and every real number except $0$ can be expressed as the reciprocal of some real number. Therefore, the range of $f(x)=\\frac{1}{1-x}$ consists of all real numbers except $0$. In interval notation, this is $\\boxed{(-\\infty,0)\\cup (0,\\infty)}$."
