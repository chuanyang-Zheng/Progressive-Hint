    "problem": "You have two circles, one with radius $r$ and the other with radius $R$. You wish for the difference in the areas of these two circles to be less than or equal to 5$\\pi$. If $r+R=10$, what is the maximum difference in the lengths of the radii?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We want $\\pi R^{2}-\\pi r^{2}\\leq 5\\pi$. Dividing by $\\pi$, we have $R^{2}-r^{2}\\leq 5$. Factor the left-hand side to get $(R+r)(R-r)\\leq 5$. Substituting 10 for $R+r$ gives $10(R-r)\\leq 5 \\implies R-r \\leq 1/2$. So the maximum difference in the lengths of the radii is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$."
