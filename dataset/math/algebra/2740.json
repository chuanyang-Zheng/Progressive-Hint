    "problem": "If $f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 3x - 4$, $g(x) = x^3 + 5x^2 + 9x - 2$, then find the constant term of $f(g(x))$.",
    "level": "Level 5",

    "solution": "Since $f(g(x)) = g(x)^3 - 6g(x)^2 + 3g(x) - 4$, it suffices to identify the constant terms of $g(x)^3$, $g(x)^2$, and $g(x)$. When expanding $g(x)^3$, we notice that the only way to obtain the constant term is to multiply the constant term with $g(x)$ by itself multiple (3) times: $(-2) \\times (-2) \\times (-2) = -8$. Similarly, the constant term of $g(x)^2$ is $(-2) \\times (-2) = 4$. The constant term in $g(x)$ is $-2$. Substituting gives $(-8) - 6 \\cdot 4 + 3 \\cdot (-2) - 4 = -8 - 24 - 6 - 4 = \\boxed{-42}$."
