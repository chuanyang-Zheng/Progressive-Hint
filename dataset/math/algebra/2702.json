    "problem": "The midpoint of a line segment is located at $(3, -2)$. If one of the endpoints is $(1, 6)$, what is the other endpoint? Express your answer as an ordered pair.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the other endpoint be $(x, y)$. We know that $\\frac{1 + x}{2} = 3$, so $x = 5$. We also know that $\\frac{6 + y}{2} = -2$, so $y = -10$. Therefore, the other endpoint is $\\boxed{(5, -10)}$."
