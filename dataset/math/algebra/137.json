    "problem": "Because of redistricting, Liberty Middle School's enrollment increased to 598 students. This is an increase of $4\\%$ over last year's enrollment. What was last year's enrollment?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If we knew last year's enrollment at Liberty Middle School, we would multiply by $1.04$ to get the new enrollment of $598$ students. Working backward, we can divide $598$ by $1.04$ to get $\\boxed{575\\text{ students}}$. Alternatively, we could solve the equation $x + 0.04x = 598$, where $x$ is last year's enrollment."
