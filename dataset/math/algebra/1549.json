    "problem": "The sum of two numbers is 40 and their difference is 12. What is their product?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let's start by rewriting this problem into equation form:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx + y &= 40, \\\\\nx - y &= 12.\n\\end{align*}We want to find $xy$, so let's find $x$ and $y$ separately.\n\nBegin by adding the two equations:  \\begin{align*}\n2x &= 52 \\\\\nx &= 26\n\\end{align*}Now, subtract the two equations \\begin{align*}\n2y &= 28 \\\\\ny &= 14\n\\end{align*}So then $x \\cdot y = 26 \\cdot 14 = \\boxed{364}$."
