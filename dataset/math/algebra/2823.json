    "problem": "What is the slope of a line perpendicular to the line whose equation is $\\frac{x}4-\\frac{y}5=1$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "In slope-intercept form, the given equation becomes $y=\\frac{5}{4}x-5$.  The slope of this line is $\\frac{5}{4}$, so the slope of a line perpendicular to this one is the negative of the reciprocal of $\\frac{5}{4}$, or $\\boxed{-\\frac{4}{5}}.$"
