    "problem": "What is the sum of all integers $x$ for which $-30 \\leq x \\leq 26$ ?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The sum of all integers $y$ for which $-26\\le y\\le26$ is 0 since for every negative term there is a positive term of the same absolute value. Thus, the sum of all integers $x$ for which $-30\\le x\\le26$ is $-30-29-28-27=-30\\times4+1+2+3=-120+6=\\boxed{-114}$."
