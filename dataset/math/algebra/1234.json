    "problem": "The ratio of $x$ to $y$ is $1$ to $2$. What is the value of $x$ if $y=4x-36$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let's write the first sentence as an equation: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{x}{y} &= \\frac{1}{2}, \\\\\n2x &= y.\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow, we can substitute this into the given equation to find $x$: \\begin{align*}\n2x &= 4x - 36, \\\\\n36 &= 2x, \\\\\n\\boxed{18} &= x.\n\\end{align*}"
