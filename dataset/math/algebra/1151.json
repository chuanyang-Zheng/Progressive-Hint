    "problem": "The ratio of two numbers is $3:5$. When 4 is subtracted from the lesser of the two numbers and 8 is added to the larger of the two, the new ratio is $2:7$. What is the greater of the two numbers before 8 is added to it?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $a$ be the smaller of the two numbers and let $b$ be the larger of the two. Then $\\dfrac{a}{b}=\\dfrac{3}{5}$, so $5a=3b$. Additionally, $\\dfrac{a-4}{b+8}=\\dfrac{2}{7}$, so cross multiplying gives $7(a-4)=2(b+8)$. We now have a system of two linear equations; solving gives $a=12$, $b=20$. Since the question asks us for the value of $b$, our answer is $\\boxed{20}$."
