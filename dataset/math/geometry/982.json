    "problem": "What is the mean of the measures of the three exterior angles of a triangle if two of the interior angles have measures of 63 and 78 degrees?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The exterior angles of a triangle sum to $360^\\circ$, so the average of their measures is $360^\\circ/3 = \\boxed{120^\\circ}$."
