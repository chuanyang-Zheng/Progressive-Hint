    "problem": "The volume of a cylinder is 60 cubic centimeters. What is the number of cubic centimeters in the volume of the sphere it circumscribes?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "We begin by drawing a diagram: [asy]\nimport solids; size(150); import three; defaultpen(linewidth(0.8)); currentprojection = orthographic(5,0,2);\nrevolution c = cylinder((0,0,0), 1, 2);\ndraw(c,black);\ndraw(Circle((0,1),1));\ndraw((-1,1)..(0,.7)..(1,1)); draw((-1,1)..(0,1.3)..(1,1),linetype(\"2 4\")); dot((0,1));\n[/asy]\n\nLet the radius of the sphere be $r$.  We see the radius of the cylinder is $r$ and the height of the cylinder is $2r$.  Thus, from the cylinder's volume we have \\[60 = \\pi (r^2)(2r) = 2\\pi r^3.\\]  Dividing both sides by 2 yields $\\pi r^3 = 30$.  The volume of the sphere is \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 = \\frac{4}{3}(30) = \\boxed{40}\\] cubic centimeters.  (Notice that we didn't have to solve for $r$!)"
