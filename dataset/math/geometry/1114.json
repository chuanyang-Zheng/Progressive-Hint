    "problem": "The intersection of the graphic solutions of all three inequalities listed below form an enclosed region in the coordinate plane.  What is the area of this region?  Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$. \\[\n\\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{l}\n(x-4)^2+y^2\\leq 16 \\\\\ny \\geq x-4 \\\\\ny\\geq -\\frac{1}{3}x\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\n\\]",

    "solution": "The solution set of the first inequality is a closed disk whose center is (4,0) and whose radius is 4.  Each of the second two inequalities describes a line ($y=x-4$ and $y=-\\frac{1}{3}x$, respectively), as well as the region above it.  The intersection of these three sets is the shaded region shown.  This region consists of a triangle, marked 1, along with a sector of a circle, marked 2.  The vertices of the triangle are (0,0), (4,0) and the intersection point of $y=x-4$ and $y=-\\frac{1}{3}x$.  Setting the right-hand sides of these two equations equal to each other, we find $x=3$ and $y=-1$.  Therefore, the height of the triangle is 1 unit and the base of the triangle is 4 units, so the area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}(1)(4)=2$ square units.  The central angle of the shaded sector is $180^\\circ-45^\\circ=135^\\circ$, so its area is $\\frac{135}{360}\\pi(4)^2=6\\pi$ square units.  In total, the area of the shaded region is $\\boxed{6\\pi+2}$ square units.\n\n[asy]\nsize(8cm);\nimport graph;\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(8));\nfill((0,0)--(3,-1)--(4,0)+4*dir(45)..(4,0)+4*dir(90)..(4,0)+4*dir(135)..cycle,gray);\ndraw(Circle((4,0),4));\ndraw((-3,1)--(9,-3),Arrows(4));\ndraw((-1,-5)--(9,5),Arrows(4));\ndraw((-2,0)--(9.5,0),Arrows(4));\ndraw((0,-5)--(0,5),Arrows(4));\nlabel(\"$y=-\\frac{1}{3}x$\",(8.0,-3.5));\nlabel(\"$y=x-4$\",(8.5,3.2));\nlabel(\"1\",((4,0)+(3,-1))/3);\nlabel(\"2\",(3,2));[/asy]"
