    "problem": "Two sides of an isosceles triangle are 15 cm and 10 cm. What is the greatest possible perimeter of this triangle, in centimeters?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The third side must be equal in length to one of the first two sides. To maximize the perimeter, we set the third side equal to 15 cm. The perimeter is then $15+15+10=\\boxed{40}$ centimeters."
