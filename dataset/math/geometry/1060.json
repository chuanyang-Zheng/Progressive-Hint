    "solution": "The surface area of the solid can be split into four pieces:  the top and bottom, the curved side, and the flat side.\n\nThe top and bottom pieces are semicircles with radius 6; together, they add up to a circle with radius 6 and area $\\pi(6^2)=36\\pi$.\n\nThe curved side can be rolled out to a rectangle with height 10.  The width of this rectangle is half the circumference of the base of the cylinder, which is $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 2\\pi\\cdot 6 = 6\\pi$.  Thus the area of the curved side is $10\\cdot 6\\pi = 60\\pi$.\n\nThe flat side is a rectangle with height 10.  The width of this rectangle is the diameter of the cylinder, which is $6\\cdot 2 = 12$.  Thus the area of the flat side is $10\\cdot 12 = 120$.\n\nFinally, the total surface area of the solid is $36\\pi+60\\pi+120=\\boxed{96\\pi+120}$."
