    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The area of the square is $6^{2}=36$ square centimeters. The area of the four quarter-circles with radius 3 is equivalent to the area of one circle with radius 3, or $\\pi\\cdot3^{2}=9\\pi.$ So, the area of the shaded region is $36-9\\pi.$ Thus, $a=36$ and $b=9,$ so $a+b=\\boxed{45}.$"
