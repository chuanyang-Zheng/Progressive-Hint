    "problem": "An isosceles trapezoid is inscribed in a semicircle as shown below, such that the three shaded regions are congruent. The radius of the semicircle is one meter. How many square meters are in the area of the trapezoid? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\n\n[asy]\nfill((0,10)..(-10,0)--(10,0)..cycle,black);\nfill((-10,0)--(-5,8.7)--(5,8.7)--(10,0)--cycle,white);\ndraw((0,10)..(-10,0)--(10,0)..cycle);\ndraw((-10,0)--(-5,8.7)--(5,8.7)--(10,0)--cycle);\n[/asy]",

    "solution": "Because the shaded regions are congruent, each of the three marked angles is equal.  Therefore, each of them measures 60 degrees.  It follows that the line segments in the figure divide the trapezoid into three equilateral triangles.  The area of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is $s^2\\sqrt{3}/4$, and the side length of each of these triangles is equal to the radius of the circle.  Therefore, the area of the trapezoid is $3\\cdot (1\\text{ m})^2\\sqrt{3}/4=3\\sqrt{3}/4$ square meters.  To the nearest tenth, the area of the trapezoid is $\\boxed{1.3}$ square meters.\n\n[asy]\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7));\nfill((0,10)..(-10,0)--(10,0)..cycle,black);\nfill((-10,0)--(-5,8.7)--(5,8.7)--(10,0)--cycle,white);\ndraw((0,10)..(-10,0)--(10,0)..cycle);\ndraw((-10,0)--(-5,8.7)--(5,8.7)--(10,0)--cycle);\ndraw((-5,8.7)--(0,0)--(5,8.7));\ndraw(anglemark((-5,8.7),(0,0),(-10,0),30));\ndraw(anglemark((5,8.7),(0,0),(-5,8.7),35));\ndraw(anglemark((10,0),(0,0),(5,8.7),30));\n[/asy]"
