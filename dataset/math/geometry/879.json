There are two such points; these are the intersections of the unit circle and the line $y=-0.31$, shown in red above.  Therefore, there are ${2}$ values of $x$ with $0^\\circ \\le x < 360^\\circ$ such that $\\sin x = -0.31$.  There are also two values of $x$ such that $360^\\circ \\le x < 720^\\circ$ and $\\sin x = -0.31$, and two values of $x$ such that $720^\\circ \\le x < 1080^\\circ$ and $\\sin x = -0.31$.\n\nBut we're asked how many values of $x$ between $0^\\circ$ and $990^\\circ$ satisfy $\\sin x = -0.31$.  As described above, there are 4 such values from $0^\\circ$ to $720^\\circ$, but what about the two values between $720^\\circ$ and $1080^\\circ$?\n\nWe see that the points on the unit circle with $y=-0.31$ are in the third and fourth quadrants.  So, the angles between $720^\\circ$ and $1080^\\circ$ with negative sines are between $720^\\circ + 180^\\circ = 900^\\circ$ and $1080^\\circ$.  Moreover, the one in the third quadrant is less than $720^\\circ + 270^\\circ = 990^\\circ$, so the angle in the fourth quadrant must be greater than $990^\\circ$.  This means that there's one value of $x$ between $720^\\circ$ and $990^\\circ$ such that $\\sin x = -0.31$.  Therefore, we have a total of $\\boxed{5}$ values of $x$ such that $\\sin x = -0.31$."
