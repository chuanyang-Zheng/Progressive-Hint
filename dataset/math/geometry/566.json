    "solution": "A cylinder with radius $r$ and height $h$ has volume $\\pi r^2 h$; a cone with the same height and radius has volume $(1/3)\\pi r^2 h$.  Thus we see the cone has $1/3$ the volume of the cylinder, so the space between the cylinder and cone has $2/3$ the volume of the cylinder, which is $(2/3)(72\\pi) = \\boxed{48\\pi}$."
