This can easily be verified using Heron's Formula. In fact, it is easy to find that a $13:14:15$ triangle is merely two $9:12:15$ and $5:12:13$ right triangles mashed together at the common leg.\n\nRegardless, the first step is finding the area of the triangle. Since the perimeter is $13 + 14 + 15 = 42,$ we have that $s = 21.$ Therefore, \\begin{align*}\n[\\triangle ABC] &= \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{21(21 - 13)(21 - 14)(21 - 15)} = \\sqrt{21 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{7 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2} = \\sqrt{7^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 2^4} \\\\\n&= 7 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2^2 = 84.\n\\end{align*}By the Angle Bisector Theorem, we know that $BD : DC = AB : AC = 13 : 15.$ That means that the area of $\\triangle ABD$ to $\\triangle ADC$ must also have the $13 : 15$ ratio, and that means the ratio of $[\\triangle ADC] : [\\triangle ABC]$ is $15 : 28.$\n\nThen, $[\\triangle ADC] = \\frac{15}{28} \\cdot [\\triangle ABC] = \\frac{15}{28} \\cdot 84 = \\boxed{45}.$"
