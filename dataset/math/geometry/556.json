    "problem": "The circumference of the interior of a cylindrical water glass is $3\\pi$ inches, and its interior height is 4 inches. How many cubic inches of liquid can the glass hold? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Let the glass have base radius $r$ inches, so $3\\pi = 2\\pi r \\Rightarrow r = 3/2$.  It follows that the glass has volume (and can hold) $\\pi (3/2)^2(4) = \\boxed{9\\pi}$ cubic inches of liquid."
