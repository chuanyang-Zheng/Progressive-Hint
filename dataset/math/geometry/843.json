    "solution": "If we let $x = $ the side length of the triangle, then we can find the area of the triangle in terms of $x$ and then set it equal to $16 \\sqrt{3}$ to find $x$. The base of the triangle has length $x$. To find the altitude, we notice that drawing an altitude splits the equilateral triangle into two $30-60-90$ triangles with the longest side having length $x$. Since the ratio of the side lengths of a $30-60-90$ triangle is $1:\\sqrt{3}:2$, the altitude will have length $\\frac{x\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and the area of the triangle will be $\\frac{1}{2}x\\left(\\frac{x\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)=\\frac{x^2\\sqrt{3}}{4}$. Setting this equal to $16 \\sqrt{3}$, we have that $\\frac{x^2\\sqrt{3}}{4}=16\\sqrt{3}.$\n\nSolving for $x$, we get that $x=8$. Since the side length of the triangle is $8$ and the square and triangle have equal perimeters, the square has a side length of $\\frac{8 \\cdot 3}{4}=6$. If we draw the diagonal of the square, we notice that it splits the square into two $45-45-90$ triangles with legs of length $6$. A $45-45-90$ triangle has side length ratios of $1:1:\\sqrt{2}$, so the diagonal of the square has length $\\boxed{6\\sqrt{2}}$ cm."
