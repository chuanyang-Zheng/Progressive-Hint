    "problem": "The surface area of a particular cube is 600 square inches. When the edges of the cube are doubled in length, what is the volume of the new cube, in cubic inches?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Let $s$ be the original side length, in inches. We originally have $6s^2 = 600,$ so $s=10.$ Doubling $s,$ the volume becomes $20^3=\\boxed{8000}$ cubic inches."
