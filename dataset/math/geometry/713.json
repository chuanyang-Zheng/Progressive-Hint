    "problem": "How many edges does an octagonal prism have?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The two bases are octagons, each with 8 sides, so the bases have a total of $8\\times2=16$ edges. Then there are edges connecting the two bases. With one edge for each vertex of a base, we have 8 edges connecting the bases. So the total number of edges is $16+8=\\boxed{24}$."
