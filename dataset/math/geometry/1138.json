    "problem": "Six spheres of radius $1$ are positioned so that their centers are at the vertices of a regular hexagon of side length $2$. The six spheres are internally tangent to a larger sphere whose center is the center of the hexagon.  An eighth sphere is externally tangent to the six smaller spheres and internally tangent to the larger sphere.  What is the radius of this eighth sphere?",

    "solution": "First, take a cross-section through the plane of the hexagon:\n[asy]\nfor (int i=0; i<6; ++i)\n{\n\tdraw(Circle(2*dir(60*i),1));\n    draw(2*dir(60*i)--2*dir(60*i+60));\n}\ndraw(Circle((0,0),3),dotted);\ndraw((0,0)--3*dir(120));\ndot((0,0) ^^ 2*dir(120) ^^ 3*dir(120));\n[/asy]\nSince the side length of the hexagon is $2,$ the distance from the center of the hexagon to each of its vertices is also $2.$ Combined with the fact that the radius of each of the smaller spheres is $1,$ we see that the radius of the larger sphere is $2 + 1 = 3.$\n\nTo find the radius of the eighth sphere, we take a cross-section perpendicular to the plane of the hexagon, which passes through two opposite vertices of the hexagon:\n[asy]\ndraw(Circle((2,0),1));\ndraw(Circle((-2,0),1));\ndraw((-2,0)--(2,0));\ndraw(Circle((0,1.5),1.5),dotted);\ndraw(Circle((0,0),3));\ndot((-2,0) ^^ (2,0) ^^ (0,0) ^^ (0,1.5));\ndraw((-2,0)--(0,1.5)--(2,0));\ndraw((0,0)--(0,3));\ndraw(rightanglemark((-2,0),(0,0),(0,3)));\nlabel(\"$O$\",(0,0),S);\nlabel(\"$P$\",(0,1.5),NW);\nlabel(\"$A$\",(-2,0),SW);\n[/asy]\n(Here $A$ is a vertex of the hexagon, $O$ is the center of the hexagon, and $P$ is the center of the eighth sphere.) Let $r$ be the radius of the eighth sphere, centered at $P.$ Then $AP = r + 1$ and $OP = 3 - r$ (since the radius of the larger sphere is $3$). We also know that $AO = 2,$ since $A$ is a vertex of the hexagon and $O$ is the center of the hexagon. Thus, by Pythagoras, \\[2^2 + (3-r)^2 = (r+1)^2,\\]or $r^2 - 6r + 13 = r^2 + 2r + 1.$ Then $8r = 12,$ and so $r = \\boxed{\\tfrac{3}{2}}.$"
