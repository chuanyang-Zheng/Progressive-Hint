    "solution": "We break the belt into six pieces, three where the belt touches no circle and three where it does.\n\nFirst consider the portion of the belt that does not touch a circle.  Each segment is the length of two radii, or $20$ cm.  There are three such segments, or $60$ cm in total.\n\nNow consider the portion of the belt that does touch a circle.  Because there are three circles, the belt will touch each circle for $\\frac{1}{3}$ of its circumference.  Since it does this three times, this is the length of these segments combined, which is the circumference of a full circle, which is $20\\pi$ cm for a circle of radius $10$ cm.\n\nTherefore the length of the belt is $60 + 20\\pi$ cm.  From this we conclude that $a = 60$ and $b = 20,$ and so $a+b = \\boxed{80}.$"
