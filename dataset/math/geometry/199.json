    "problem": "Elliott Farms has a silo for storage. The silo is a right circular cylinder topped by a right circular cone, both having the same radius. The height of the cone is half the height of the cylinder. The diameter of the base of the silo is 10 meters and the height of the entire silo is 27 meters. What is the volume, in cubic meters, of the silo? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\n\n[asy]\nsize(150);\ndraw((0,0)--(0,18)--(5,27)--(10,18)--(10,0),linewidth(1));\ndraw((0,0)..(5,-1)..(10,0),linewidth(1));\ndraw((0,0)..(5,1)..(10,0),linetype(\"0 4\")+linewidth(1));\ndraw((0,18)..(5,17)..(10,18),linewidth(1));\ndraw((0,18)..(5,19)..(10,18),linetype(\"0 4\")+linewidth(1));\n\ndraw((15,27)--(16,27),linewidth(1));\ndraw((15,0)--(16,0),linewidth(1));\ndraw((15.5,27)--(15.5,16),linewidth(1));\ndraw((15.5,0)--(15.5,11),linewidth(1));\nlabel(\"27 meters\",(15.5,13.5));\n\n[/asy]",

    "solution": "To begin, see that if the ratio of the height of the cone to the height of the cylinder is 1:2, then the ratio of the cone height to the entire silo height is 1:3.  Therefore, the height of the cone is $27/3=9$ meters and the height of the cylinder is $18$ meters.  We can now use the formulas for the volume of a cylinder and the volume of a cone, with our given radius of 5: $$V_{cone}=\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot b \\cdot h=\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot (\\pi\\cdot 5^2)\\cdot 9=75\\pi$$$$V_{cylinder}=\\pi r^2\\cdot h=\\pi 5^2\\cdot 18=450\\pi$$$$V_{silo}=V_{cone}+V_{cylinder}=75\\pi+450\\pi=\\boxed{525\\pi}.$$"
