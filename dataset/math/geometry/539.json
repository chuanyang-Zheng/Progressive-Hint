    "solution": "The angles in a triangle sum to 180 degrees, so the measure of each angle of an equilateral triangle is 60 degrees.  Therefore, the measure of angle $EAD$ is 60 degrees.  Also, angle $BAD$ measures 90 degrees.  Therefore, the measure of angle $BAE$ is $90^\\circ-60^\\circ=\\boxed{30}$ degrees."
