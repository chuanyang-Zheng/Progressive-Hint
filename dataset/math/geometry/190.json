    "problem": "A right circular cylinder with radius 2 inches and height 1 inch has the same volume as a second right circular cylinder. The radius of the second cylinder is 1 inch. How many inches are in the height of the second cylinder?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Let the second cylinder have height $h$ inches.  Setting the two volumes equal we have $\\pi(2^2)(1)=\\pi(1^2)(h) \\Rightarrow h = \\boxed{4}$ inches."
