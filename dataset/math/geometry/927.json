    "problem": "A cubic block of wood with side lengths of 10 cm is cut into smaller cubes with side lengths of 1 cm. What is the ratio of the surface area of the larger block of wood to the combined surface area of the smaller blocks of wood? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The large cube had a surface area of $6\\cdot10^2=600$ sq cm, and the smaller blocks have a total area of $6\\cdot1000=6000$ sq cm. The ratio is \\[\n\\frac{600}{6000}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{10}}.\n\\]"
