    "problem": "A pyramid has 6 vertices and 6 faces. How many edges does it have?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "A pyramid with $6$ faces would have a pentagon on the bottom and five triangles on the sides. There are thus $5$ edges on the bottom along the pentagon and an additional $5$ edges from the triangles on the sides, for a total of $5+5 = \\boxed{10\\;\\text{edges}}$."
