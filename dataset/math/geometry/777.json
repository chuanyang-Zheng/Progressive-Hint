    "solution": "From smallest to largest, the semicircles have radii of 2, 4, 6, and 8 cm, respectively. Each has area $\\frac{r^2}{2}\\pi$, so from smallest to largest the semicircles have area $2\\pi$, $8\\pi$, $18\\pi$, and $32\\pi$ sq cm, respectively. The shaded area is that of the largest minus the second largest, plus the second smallest minus the smallest, so the total area is $32\\pi-18\\pi+8\\pi-2\\pi=20\\pi$ sq cm, which rounds to $\\boxed{62.8}$ sq cm."
