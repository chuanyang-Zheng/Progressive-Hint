    "problem": "An equilateral triangle of side 12 centimeters is rotated about an altitude to form a cone. What is the number of cubic centimeters in the volume of the cone?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The radius of the cone is half the side length of the triangle, which is 6 cm.  The height of the cone is an altitude of the triangle, which is $6\\sqrt{3}$.  Therefore, the volume of the cone is  \\[\\frac13\\cdot (6^2\\pi)(6\\sqrt{3}) =\\boxed{72\\pi\\sqrt{3}}\\text{ cubic centimeters}.\\]"
