    "problem": "A triangle has sides measuring 1 unit and 3 units. The length of the third side is an integer value of units. What is the length of the third side, in units?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Call the length of the third side $n$. By the triangle inequality, $1+3>n$ and $1+n>3$, or $2<n<4$. The only integer $n$ which satisfies this is $\\boxed{3}$."
