    "problem": "If the angles of a trapezoid form an arithmetic sequence and the smallest angle measures $60^{\\circ}$, what is the measure of the largest angle, in degrees?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Let the common difference of this arithmetic sequence be $d$. The four angles of the trapezoid are $60$, $60+d$, $60+2d$, and $60+3d$. Since the interior angles in a trapezoid add up to equal 360 degrees, we have the equation $60+(60+d)+(60+2d)+(60+3d)=360\\Rightarrow d=20$. Thus, the largest angle in the trapezoid is $60+3\\cdot20=\\boxed{120}$ degrees."
