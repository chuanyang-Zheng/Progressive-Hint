    "solution": "The volume is the pyramid is $\\frac{1}{3}s^2h$, where $s$ is the side length of the base and $h$ is the height of the pyramid.  Therefore, the area of the base is $s^2=(63,\\!960\\text{ m}^3)/\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot 30\\text{ m}\\right)=6396$ square meters.  Calling the center of the base $D$, we apply the Pythagorean theorem to triangle $ABD$ to get \\[AB=\\sqrt{h^2+(s/2)^2}=\\sqrt{h^2+s^2/4}=\\sqrt{30^2+6396/4}=\\sqrt{2499},\\] which is closer to $\\sqrt{2500}=\\boxed{50}$ meters than to $\\sqrt{2401}=49$ meters, since $49.5^2=2450.25$."
