One suspects that $\\overline{CM}\\perp\\overline{AB}$, which  can be confirmed by noting that $\\triangle AMG\\cong\\triangle BMG$ since all corresponding sides are congruent.  Since $AG=AB=2$ and $AM=\\frac{1}{2}AB=1$, we can compute $MG=\\sqrt{3}$ using the Pythagorean Theorem.  We now recall an important property of the centroid: it lies on all three medians and divides each of them in a 2 to 1 ratio.  In other words, $CG=2(MG)=2\\sqrt{3}$.  We deduce that $CM=3\\sqrt{3}$, so we can finally compute length $AC$ by using the Pythagorean theorem in $\\triangle AMC$ to find \\[ AC = \\sqrt{1^2+(3\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\sqrt{28} = 2\\sqrt{7}. \\]In the same manner $BC=2\\sqrt{7}$ as well, giving a perimeter of $\\boxed{2+4\\sqrt{7}}$."
