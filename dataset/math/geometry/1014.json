    "solution": "We start by labeling everything first: [asy]\nfill((6,0)--(9,0)--(9,12)--(6,8)--cycle,gray(0.7));\ndraw((0,0)--(9,0)--(9,12)--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((6,8)--(6,0),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((5.6,0)--(5.6,0.4)--(6,0.4));\ndraw((8.6,0)--(8.6,0.4)--(9,0.4));\nlabel(\"6\",(3,0),S);\nlabel(\"10\",(3,4),NW);\nlabel(\"3\",(7.5,0),S);\nlabel(\"A\",(0,0),SW);\nlabel(\"B\",(9,0),SE);\nlabel(\"C\",(9,12),NW);\nlabel(\"D\",(6,0),S);\nlabel(\"E\",(6,8),NW);\n[/asy] First of all, we can see that $DE = 8$ since we recognize a $3:4:5$ triangle in $ADE$. Also, thanks to SAS Similarity (or AA also works), we see that $\\triangle ABC \\sim \\triangle ADE.$ That means that $ABC$ is also a $3:4:5$ triangle. Since $AB = 9,$ that means that $AC = 15$ and $BC = 12.$\n\nWe find the shaded area of $BCED$ by subtracting the areas of $ABC$ and $ADE.$ The area of $ABC$ is simply $\\dfrac{9 \\cdot 12}{2} = 54,$ and the area of $ADE$ is $\\dfrac{6 \\cdot 8}{2} = 24.$ Therefore, our desired area is $54 - 24 = \\boxed{30} \\text{ cm}^2.$"
