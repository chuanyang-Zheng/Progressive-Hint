    "problem": "Triangle $ABC$ with vertices at $A(1, 1)$, $B(1, -2)$ and $C(5, -2)$ is translated up 3 units and then dilated with respect to the origin by a factor of 2. What are the new coordinates of point $C$? Express your answer as an ordered pair.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "After being translated, $C$ is $(5,-2+3)=(5,1)$. Dilating by a factor of 2 gives $(2 \\cdot 5, 2 \\cdot 1)=\\boxed{(10,2)}$."
