    "problem": "A right triangle has leg lengths of 7 and 24 units. A second triangle is similar to the first triangle and has a hypotenuse of 100 units. What is the length, in units, of the shorter leg of the second triangle?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "$7^2+24^2=625=25^2$, so the hypotenuse is $25$. $100$ is $4$ times this, so the shorter leg of the second triangle is $4$ times the shorter leg of the original triangle, or $4(7)=\\boxed{28}$."
