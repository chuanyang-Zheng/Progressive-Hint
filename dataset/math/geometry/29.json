    "problem": "The largest interior angle in an isosceles trapezoid is 4 times the measure of the smallest interior angle. What is the measure, in degrees, of the smallest interior angle in the trapezoid?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The interior angles of a trapezoid consist of two pairs of congruent angles.  Therefore, if the smaller angle measure is $x$ and the larger angle measure is $4x$, then the measures of the four angles are $x$, $x$, $4x$, and $4x$.  Summing these measures and setting the result equal to $360$ degrees, we find $10x=360^\\circ\\implies x=\\boxed{36}$ degrees."
