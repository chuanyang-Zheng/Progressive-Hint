    "problem": "A bottled-water company has designed a new cup for its dispenser. The cup will be a right circular cone with a three-inch radius. How tall will the cup need to be to hold $30 \\pi$ cubic inches of water?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The volume of a cone with radius $r$ and height $h$ is \\[\\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h.\\] Therefore, we want $h$ to satisfy \\[\\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot h = 30 \\pi,\\] so $h = \\boxed{10}$."
