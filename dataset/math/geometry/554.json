    "problem": "A triangle has vertices $A(-4, -1)$, $B (2, -1)$ and $C(1, 3)$. What is the area, in square units, of triangle $ABC$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Let side $AB$ be the base; it has length $2+4=6$ since it is horizontal.  The altitude from $C$ to $AB$ is the length of the vertical distance from the line to $C$, which is $1+3=4$.  Thus the area is\n\n$$\\frac{6(4)}{2}=\\boxed{12}$$"
