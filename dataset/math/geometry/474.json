    "problem": "An ice cream cone consists of a sphere of vanilla ice cream and a right circular cone that  has the same diameter as the sphere. If the ice cream  melts, it will exactly fill the cone.  Assume that the melted ice cream occupies $75\\%$ of the volume of the frozen ice cream. What is the ratio of the cone's height to its radius? (Note: A cone with radius $r$ and height $h$ has volume $\\pi r^2 h/3$, and a sphere with radius $r$ has volume $4\\pi r^3/3$.)",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Let $r$ be the radius  of the sphere and cone, and let $h$ be the height of the cone. Then the conditions of the problem imply that $$\n\\frac{3}{4} \\left( \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^{3} \\right) = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^{2}h, \\quad \\text{so}\\quad\n\\ h = 3r.\n$$ Therefore, the ratio of $h$ to $r$ is $\\boxed{3:1}$."
