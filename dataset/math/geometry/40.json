    "solution": "Since $\\triangle ADB$ is the mirror image of $\\triangle ADC$, we have that $m\\angle B = m\\angle C$.  Since $\\triangle ABC$ is a triangle, we have that $m\\angle A + m\\angle B + m\\angle C = 180^\\circ$.  Solving, we find that $m\\angle B = \\frac{180^\\circ - 40^\\circ}{2} = \\boxed{70^\\circ}$."
