    "problem": "Two right circular cylinders have equal volume. The first cylinder has a radius of 6 inches and a height of 12 inches. What is the number of inches in the height of the second cylinder if its radius is 8 inches? Express your answer as a mixed number.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Let the second cylinder have height $h$ inches.  Setting the two volumes equal, we have \\[\\pi (6^2)(12) = \\pi (8^2) h.\\]   Solving yields $h = \\frac{27}{4} = \\boxed{6 \\frac{3}{4}}$ inches."
