    "solution": "Since each non-hexagonal face is a rectangle with base 6 inches and height 3 feet, each face has an area of $6$ inches $\\times 3$ feet $= .5$ feet $\\times 3$ feet $= 1.5$ square feet per face.  Since there are 6 faces (6 edges to a hexagon), that makes for a total area of $\\boxed{9}$ square feet."
