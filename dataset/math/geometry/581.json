    "problem": "A cylindrical can that is six inches high has a label that is $60\\pi$ square inches in area and exactly covers the outside of the can excluding the top and bottom lids. What is the radius of the can, in inches?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The surface area of the can excluding the lids is expressed as Circumference $\\times$ Height.  Therefore, since the height is 6 inches, the circumference is $10\\pi$.  Since Circumference $= 2\\pi r$, we have radius = $\\boxed{5\\text{ inches}}$."
