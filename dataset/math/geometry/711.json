    "problem": "Let $ABCD$ be a regular tetrahedron with side length 2. The plane parallel to edges $AB$ and $CD$ and lying halfway between them cuts $ABCD$ into two pieces. Find the surface area of one of these pieces.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The plane intersects each face of the tetrahedron in a midline of the face; by symmetry it follows that the intersection of the plane with the tetrahedron is a square of side length 1. The surface area of each piece is half the total surface area of the tetrahedron plus the area of the square, that is, $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 4\\cdot \\frac{2^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4}+1=\\boxed{1+2\\sqrt{3}}$."
