    "solution": "Let $s$ be the side length of the square in Figure A.\n\nBecause the area of the semicircle in Figure A is half the area of the circle in Figure B, these two figures have the same radius, $r$. In figure A, if we draw a radius of the semicircle to a vertex of the inscribed square, we obtain a right triangle whose sides are $s/2$, $s$, and $r$. The Pythagorean Theorem tells us that $r^2 = s^2 + s^2/4$. After some manipulation, we see that $$s = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}}r.$$ In Figure B, we see that the diameter of the circle makes up a diagonal of the square. Because the diagonal has length $2r$, it follows that the side length of the square is $2r/\\sqrt{2} = r\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nTo calculate the ratio of the areas, we square the ratio of the sides: $$\\left(\\frac{\\frac{2r}{\\sqrt{5}}}{r\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{10}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4}{10} = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}.$$"
