    "problem": "The acute angles of a particular isosceles trapezoid each measure 40 degrees. What is the measure, in degrees, of each obtuse angle in the trapezoid?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "In an isosceles trapezoid, there are two pairs of congruent angles.  Let $x$ and $y$ be the distinct angle measures.  Since the angles of a quadrilateral sum to 360, we have $2x+2y=360$.  Setting $x=40$ we find $y=\\boxed{140}$ degrees."
