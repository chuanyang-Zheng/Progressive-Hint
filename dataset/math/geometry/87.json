    "problem": "A parallelogram has three of its vertices at $(-1,0)$, $(2,4)$ and $(2,-4)$.  What is the positive difference between the greatest possible perimeter and the least possible perimeter of the parallelogram?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "[asy]\nimport graph;\nsize(300);\nLabel f;\nf.p=fontsize(6);\nxaxis(-2,6, Ticks(f,1.0));\nyaxis(-9,9, Ticks(f,1.0));\ndot((-1,0));\nlabel(\"$A$\",(-1,0),W);\ndot((2,4));\nlabel(\"$B$\",(2,4),N);\ndot((2,-4));\nlabel(\"$C$\",(2,-4),S);\ndot((5,0));\nlabel(\"$D_1$\",(5,0),E);\ndot((-1,-8));\nlabel(\"$D_2$\",(-1,-8),S);\ndot((-1,8));\nlabel(\"$D_3$\",(-1,8),N);\n[/asy]\n\nThe three given points are labeled $A$, $B$, and $C$. The three possible values of the fourth point in the parallelogram are labelled $D_1$, $D_2$, and $D_3$, with $D_1$ being the opposite point of $A$, $D_2$ the opposite point of $B$, and $D_3$ the opposite point of $C$. The parallelogram $AD_3BC$ has the same perimeter as the parallelogram $ABCD_2$ by symmetry, so we disregard point $D_3$.\n\nWe will find the perimeter of $ABCD_2$. To calculate where point $D_2$ is, we notice that $AD_2$ must be parallel to the vertical segment $BC$, so the $x$ value of point $D_2$ must be $-1$. In addition, the length $AD_2$ must be equal to the length $BC$, which is 8. Thus, the $y$ value of point $D_2$ must be $-8$. So point $D_2$ is at $(-1,-8)$. The vertical segments of parallelogram $ABCD_2$ have length 8. To find the length of the diagonal segments $AB$ and $CD_2$, we use the distance formula between points $A$ and $B$: $AB=\\sqrt{(-1-2)^2+(0-4)^2}=5$. Thus, the perimeter of this parallelogram is $8+8+5+5=26$.\n\nWe will find the perimeter of $ABD_1C$. To calculate where point $D_1$ is, we note that since figure $ABC$ is symmetric about the $x$-axis, $D_1$ must lie on the $x$-axis, so its $y$ value is 0. We also know that the diagonals in a parallelogram bisect each other, so in order for diagonal $AD_1$ to bisect $BC$ (which crosses the $x$-axis at $x=2$), the $x$ value of $D_1$ must be 5. So point $D_1$ is at $(5,0)$. In finding the perimeter, we note that all the sides are equal in length. Since we already found side $AB$ to have length 5, the entire perimeter is $5\\cdot4=20$.\n\nThus, the positive difference between the greatest perimeter and the smallest is $26-20=\\boxed{6}$ units."
