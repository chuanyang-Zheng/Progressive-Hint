    "problem": "A water tank in the shape of a right circular cylinder has a base radius of $30$ meters and a volume of $2700\\pi$ cubic meters. What is the number of meters in the height of the tank?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Let the height measure $h$ meters.  By the formula for the area of a cylinder, which states that $V=\\pi r^2 h$ where $V, r, h$ denote volume, radius and height respectively, we have \\[2700\\pi = \\pi (30)^2 h.\\]Solving yields $h = \\boxed{3}$ meters."
