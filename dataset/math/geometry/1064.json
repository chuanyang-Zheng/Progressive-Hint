    "solution": "The overlap of the two squares is a smaller square with side length 2, so the area of the region covered by the squares is $2(4\\times 4)-(2\\times\n2)=32-4=28$. The diameter of the circle has length $\\sqrt{2^2+2^2}=\\sqrt{8}$, the length of the diagonal of the smaller square. The shaded area created by removing the circle from the squares is $28-\\pi\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{8}}{2}\\right)^2=\\boxed{28-2\\pi}$."
