    "solution": "Let us draw our triangle and altitudes and label our points of interest: [asy]\npair A, B, C, D, E, F;\nA = (0, 8);\nB = (-6, 0);\nC = (6, 0);\nD = (0, 0);\nE = foot(B,A,C);\nF = foot(C,A,B);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(A--D);\ndraw(B--E);\ndraw(C--F);\ndraw(rightanglemark(B,E,C,10));\ndraw(rightanglemark(C,F,B,10));\ndraw(rightanglemark(A,D,C,10));\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, S);\nlabel(\"$E$\", E, NE);\nlabel(\"$F$\", F, NW);\n[/asy] We have made $AB = AC = 10$ and $BC = 12.$ We can notice a few useful things. Since $ABC$ is isosceles, it follows that $AD$ is a median as well as an altitude, which is useful since that means $BD = DC = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot BC = 6.$ Now, since $DC = 6$ and $AC = 10,$ we have a $3:4:5$ Pythagorean triple and $AD = 8$. Now we can find the area of $ABC$ by finding $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot AD \\cdot BC = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 8 \\cdot 12 = 48.$\n\nNow, we can find $BE$ by using the area we just found: $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot AC \\cdot BE = 48.$ Since $AC = 10,$ that means $BE = 9.6$ By symmetry, $CF$ is also $9.6.$ Our answer is: $9.6 + 9.6 + 8 = \\boxed{27.2}.$"
