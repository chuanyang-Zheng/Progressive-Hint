    "problem": "The measure of one of the smaller base angles of an isosceles trapezoid is $60^\\circ$. The shorter base is 5 inches long and the altitude is $2 \\sqrt{3}$ inches long.

    "solution": "The triangle in the diagram is a $30-60-90$ triangle and has long leg $2\\sqrt3$.  Therefore the short leg has length 2 and hypotenuse has length 4.  The bases of the trapezoid are then 5 and $2+5+2=9$ and the legs are both length 4.  The entire trapezoid has perimeter $9+4+5+4=\\boxed{22}$."
