    "solution": "We first draw out the figure described in this problem and label the important points with circle $A$ having radius $10$ ft and circle $B$ having radius $17$ feet: [asy]\nsize(150);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(.7pt));\n\ndraw(Circle((10,17),10));\ndraw(Circle((31,17),17));\ndraw((16,25)--(16,9));\ndraw((10,17)--(31,17)--(16,9)--cycle);\ndraw((14.5,17)--(14.5,15.5)--(17.5,15.5)--(17.5,17),linewidth(.7));\ndot((10,17),linewidth(3));\ndot((16,25),linewidth(3));\ndot((31,17),linewidth(3));\ndot((16,9),linewidth(3));\ndot((16,17),linewidth(3));\nlabel(\"A\",(10,17),NW);\nlabel(\"D\",(16,25),N);\nlabel(\"B\",(31,17),NE);\nlabel(\"C\",(16,9),S);\nlabel(\"E\",(16,17),NE);\n[/asy] Since $\\overline{AC}$ is a radius of circle $A$ and $\\overline{BC}$ is a radius of circle $B$, we have that $AC=10$ and $BC=17$. Also, since $\\overline{DC}$ is a common chord to the two circles, line segment $\\overline{AB}$, which connects the centers of the two circles, must both bisect $\\overline{DC}$ and be perpendicular to it. We'll call the point of intersection of these two lines point $E$ and since $DC=16$, $\\overline{EC}$ must have length $8$.\n\nNow we notice that we have two right triangles $\\triangle AEC$ and $\\triangle BEC$. Since we know the lengths of $\\overline{AC}$ and $\\overline{EC}$, we can find the length of $\\overline{AE}$ using the Pythagorean Theorem:  \\begin{align*}\n& AE^2 + EC^2 = AC^2 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad & AE = \\sqrt{10^2-8^2}=6\n\\end{align*}  Similarly, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find that the length of $\\overline{EB}$ is $\\sqrt{17^2-8^2}=15$. The length of $\\overline{AB}$, the distance between the two centers of the circles, must be the sum of the lengths of $\\overline{AE}$ and $\\overline{EB}$, which is $6+15=\\boxed{21}$ feet."
