    "problem": "If the volume of a 2-cm-by-2cm-by-2cm cube is increased by 19 cubic centimeters to form a larger cube, what is the length in centimeters of one edge of the new cube?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The volume of the $2$-cm cube is $2^3=8$ cubic centimeters. The volume of the larger cube is $8+19=27$, so the length of one edge is $\\sqrt[3]{27}=\\boxed{3}$ cm."
