    "problem": "The lateral surface area of a cylindrical tube with a height of 6 cm is $48\\pi$ square centimeters. In cubic centimeters, what is the tube's volume? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The lateral surface area of a cylindrical tube is equal to $2\\pi rh$, where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height of the tube. Since we are told that the height is 6 cm and the lateral surface area is equal to $48\\pi$ square cm, we have the equation $2\\cdot \\pi \\cdot r \\cdot 6 = 48 \\pi \\Rightarrow r=4$. The volume of the tube is equal to $\\pi \\cdot r^2 \\cdot h = \\pi \\cdot 4^2 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{96\\pi}$ cubic cm."
