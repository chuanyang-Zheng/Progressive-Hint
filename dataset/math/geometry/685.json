    "problem": "Assume that the length of Earth's equator is exactly 25,100 miles and that the Earth is a perfect sphere.

Because $\\overline{BL}$ is parallel to the equator and Lena is at $45^\\circ$ North Latitude, $\\triangle ABL$ is a 45-45-90 triangle.  Thus, $BL=AB=\\frac{r}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nThe number of miles in the circumference of the circle parallel to the equator and through Lena is $2\\pi \\cdot BL = 2\\pi \\frac{r}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{25100}{\\sqrt{2}} \\approx 17748$ miles.  To the nearest hundred miles, this value is $\\boxed{17700}$ miles."
