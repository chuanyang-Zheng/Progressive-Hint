    "problem": "The diameter of a cone is 30 decimeters. If the height is two times the radius, what is the volume of the cone in cubic decimeters?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "If the diameter of the cone is $30$ decimeters, then the radius is $r=30/2=15$ decimeters. The height is two times the radius, so the height is $h=30$ decimeters. The volume of the cones is $\\frac13 (\\pi r^2) h = \\frac13 (\\pi 15^2) \\cdot 30 = \\boxed{2250\\pi}$ cubic decimeters."
