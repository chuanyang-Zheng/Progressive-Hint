    "problem": "Four semi-circles are shown with $AB:BC:CD = 1:2:3$. What is the ratio of the shaded area to the unshaded area in the semi circle with diameter $AD$? Express your answer as a common fraction.

    "solution": "Let the radius of the large semicircle be $6x$.  The diameter of the smallest semicircle is $\\frac{1}{1+2+3} = \\frac16$ of the diameter of the largest semicircle, so the radius of the smallest semicircle is $x$.  Similarly, the radius of the next smallest semicircle is $2x$, and the radius of the next semicircle is $3x$.  The unshaded area then is the sum of the areas of the three smallest semicircles: \\[\\frac12(x)^2\\pi + \\frac12 (2x)^2 \\pi + \\frac12(3x)^2\\pi = \\frac12(x^2 + 4x^2 + 9x^2)\\pi = (7x^2)\\pi.\\] The largest semicircle has area $\\frac12(6x)^2\\pi = 18x^2\\pi$, so the shaded area is \\[18x^2\\pi - 7x^2 \\pi = 11x^2\\pi.\\] Therefore, the desired ratio is \\[\\frac{11x^2\\pi}{7x^2\\pi} = \\boxed{\\frac{11}{7}}.\\]"
