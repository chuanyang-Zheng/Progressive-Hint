    "solution": "The box has volume $30^3=27000$ cubic cm.\n\nThe sphere has radius $30/2=15$ and volume $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi (15^3) = 2\\cdot 15 \\cdot 2\\cdot 15\\cdot 5\\pi = 30^2\\cdot 5\\pi = 4500\\pi$ cubic cm.\n\nThus, the volume of the space in the box not occupied by the sphere is $\\boxed{27000-4500\\pi}$ cubic cm."
