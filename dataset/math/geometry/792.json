    "problem": "Triangle $AXY$ is similar to triangle $ZBC$. If $AX = 6$ cm, $ZB = 18$ cm and $ZC = 63$ cm, what is the length of segment $AY$, in centimeters?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Because they are similar, $\\frac{AX}{ZB} = \\frac{AY}{ZC}$, therefore, $\\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{AY}{63} \\rightarrow AY = \\boxed{21}$"
