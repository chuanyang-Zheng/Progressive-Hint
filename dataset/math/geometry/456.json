    "problem": "What is the length, in units, of the radius of a sphere whose volume and surface area, in cubic units and square units, respectively, are numerically equal?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The volume of a sphere is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$ and the surface area is $4\\pi r^2$, so\n\\[\\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 = 4 \\pi r^2.\\]We can divide both sides by $4 \\pi r^2$, to get\n\\[\\frac{1}{3} r = 1.\\]Therefore, $r = \\boxed{3}.$"
