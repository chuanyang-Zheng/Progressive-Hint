    "solution": "In square $ABCD$, diagonal $\\overline{AC}$ divides the square into 2 equal areas.  Thus, the area of $\\triangle ACD$ is one-half of the area of square $ABCD$, and therefore is $\\frac14$ of the total area of the two squares.\n\nSince $\\overline{AC}$ is the diagonal of square $ABCD$, we have $\\angle ACB=45^{\\circ}$, so $\\angle HCJ = 45^\\circ$, which means $\\triangle CHJ$ is an isosceles right triangle.  Since $HJ = \\frac{HG}{2}$, the area of $\\triangle CHJ$ is $\\frac12(CH)(HJ) = \\frac12\\cdot \\frac{HG}{2} \\cdot \\frac{HG}{2} = \\frac18HG^2$, which means that the area of $\\triangle CHJ$ is $\\frac18$ of the area of one of the squares, or $\\frac{1}{16}$ of the total area of the two squares.  Combining the two shaded regions, $\\frac14 + \\frac{1}{16} = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{16}}$ of the two squares is shaded."
