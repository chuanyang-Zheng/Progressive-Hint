    "problem": "A solid sphere of ice with radius 4 is placed on a hollow cone (vertex pointed down) of radius 4 and height 5. When the ice melts, how much of the water will overflow the cone? Express your answer as a common fraction in terms of $\\pi$. (For this problem, we ignore the fact that the volume of water decreases when it melts.)",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The ice sphere has volume \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi (4^3) = \\frac{4^4}{3}\\pi=\\frac{256}{3}\\pi\\] and the cone has volume \\[\\frac{1}{3}\\pi(4^2)(5)=\\frac{80}{3}\\pi.\\]  When the ice melts, the amount of water that will overflow is \\[\\frac{256}{3}\\pi-\\frac{80}{3}\\pi=\\boxed{\\frac{176}{3}\\pi}.\\]"
