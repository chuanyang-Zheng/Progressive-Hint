    "problem": "An aquarium has a rectangular base that measures 100 cm by 40 cm and has a height of 50 cm. The aquarium is filled with water to a depth of 37 cm. A rock with volume $1000 \\text{cm}^3$ is then placed in the aquarium and completely submerged. By how many centimeters does the water level rise?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest 100th.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Using the volume formula $lwh = V$, the volume of water in the aquarium is $100 \\times 40 \\times 37 = 148{,}000\n\\text{ cm}^3$. When the rock is put in, the water and the rock will occupy a box-shaped region with volume $148{,}000 + 1000 = 149{,}000\n\\text{ cm}^3$. The volume of the water and the rock is $100 \\times 40\n\\times h$, where $h$ is the new height of the water. $\\text{The new\nvolume} = 4000h = 149{,}000 \\text{ cm}^3$, so the new height is $$h=\\frac{149000}{4000}=37.25 \\text{ cm}.$$After adding the rock, the water rises $37.25-37=\\boxed{0.25\\text{ cm}}$.\n\n\\[ OR \\]Because the shape of the rock is irrelevant, we may assume that the rock is shaped like a rectangular box with base measuring $100\n\\text{ cm} \\times 40 \\text{ cm}$ and height $h$ cm. Using the volume formula, $100 \\times 40 \\times h =1000$, so $h =\n\\frac{1000}{100\\times 40}=0.25 \\text{ cm}$. When the rock is put into the aquarium, the water level will rise by $\\boxed{0.25\\,\\text{ cm}}$."
