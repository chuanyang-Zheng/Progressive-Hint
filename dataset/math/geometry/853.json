    "problem": "Triangle $PQR$ is isosceles and the measure of angle $R$ is $40^\\circ$. The possible measures of angle $P$ are $x,y,z$. What is the value of the sum $x + y + z$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The remaining two angles are either 40 degrees and $180-40-40=100$ degrees, or they are both $(180-40)/2=70$ degrees.  The sum of the distinct possible values for angle $P$ is $40+100+70=\\boxed{210}$ degrees."
