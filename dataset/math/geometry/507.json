Let $A$ be the vertex of the square that is on both the side that contains $P$ and the side that contains $Q$. Because $\\overline{AM}$ is the median to the hypotenuse of right $\\triangle PAQ$, $AM=(1/2)\\cdot PQ=(1/2)\\cdot2=1$.  Thus every midpoint is 1 unit from a vertex of the square, and the set of all the midpoints forms four quarter-circles of radius 1 and with centers at the vertices of the square.  The area of the region bounded by the four arcs is $4-4\\cdot(\\pi/4)=4-\\pi$, so $100k=100(4-3.14)=\\boxed{86}$.\n\n$$\\centerline{{\\bf OR}}$$Place a coordinate system so that the vertices of the square are at $(0,0)$, $(2,0)$, $(2,2)$, and $(0,2)$.  When the segment's vertices are on the sides that contain $(0,0)$, its endpoints' coordinates can be represented as $(a,0)$ and $(0,b)$.  Let the coordinates of the midpoint of the segment be $(x,y)$.  Then $(x,y)=(a/2,b/2)$ and $a^2+b^2=4$.  Thus $x^2+y^2=(a/2)^2+(b/2)^2\n= 1$, and the midpoints of these segments form a quarter-circle with radius 1 centered at the origin.  The set of all the midpoints forms four quarter-circles, and the area of the region bounded by the four arcs is $4-4\\cdot(\\pi/4)=4-\\pi$, so $100k=100(4-3.14)=\\boxed{86}$."
