    "problem": "Let $S$ be the union of the set of all points inside a regular nonagon with side length $2$ units and the set of all points less than $1$ unit away from a point on the perimeter of the nonagon.  What, in units, is the perimeter of $S$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "$S$ looks like a nonagon with slightly rounded corners.  We draw adjacent sides of the nonagon and look at the boundary of $S$:\n\n[asy]\nsize(200);\ndraw((-7.66,-6.43)--(0,0)--(10,0)--(17.66,-6.43));\ndraw((0,5)--(10,5),blue); draw((13.21,3.83)--(20.87,-2.60),blue);\ndraw(Arc((10,0),5,50,90),red); draw(Arc((0,0),5,90,130),red);\ndraw((10,0)--(10,5),dashed); draw((0,0)--(0,5),dashed);\ndraw((10,0)--(13.21,3.83),dashed);\nlabel(\"2\",(5,0),S); label(\"1\",(10,2.5),W);\ndraw((-3.21,3.83)--(-10.87,-2.60),blue);\ndraw((-3.21,3.83)--(0,0),dashed);\n[/asy] We can split the portion of $S$ that is outside the nonagon into 9 rectangles and 9 circle sectors, thereby breaking the perimeter of $S$ into alternating straight lines (colored blue above) and curved arcs (colored red above).  The perimeter of $S$ is comprised of nine blue lines and nine red arcs.\n\nEach rectangle has side lengths 1 and 2, so each blue line is 2 units long and the total length of the blue portion of the perimeter is $2\\cdot 9 = 18$ units.\n\nAround each vertex of the nonagon, an interior angle, two right angles, and an angle of the circular sector add up to 360 degrees.  The angles inside a nonagon each measure $180(9-2)/9=140$ degrees.  Thus, each circular sector angle measures $360-90-90-140=40$ degrees.  Each sector has radius 1 and arc length $\\frac{40^\\circ}{360^\\circ}(2)(\\pi)(1)=\\frac{1}{9}(2\\pi)$, so nine of these sectors have total arc length $2\\pi$.  Thus the total length of the red portion of the perimeter is $2\\pi$ units.  (Notice that this is equal to the perimeter of a circle with radius 1, which is what the nine sectors add up to.)\n\nFinally, the perimeter of $S$ is $\\boxed{18+2\\pi}$ units."
