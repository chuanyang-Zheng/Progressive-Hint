    "problem": "The radius of a right circular cylinder is decreased by $20\\%$ and its height is increased by $25\\%$. What is the absolute value of the percent change in the volume of the cylinder?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Let the original radius and height be $r$ and $h$ respectively, so the original volume is $\\pi r^2 h$.\n\nThe new radius and height are $\\frac{4}{5}r$ and $\\frac{5}{4}h$ respectively, so the new volume is $\\pi \\left(\\frac{4}{5}r\\right)^2 \\frac{5}{4} = \\frac{4}{5} \\pi r^2 h$, which is $20\\%$ less than the original volume.\n\nHence the desired percent change is $\\boxed{20}$ percent."
