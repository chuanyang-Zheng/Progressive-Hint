    "solution": "Since $AB \\parallel DE,$ we know that $\\angle A = \\angle E$ and $\\angle B = \\angle D.$ That works out nicely, since that means $\\triangle ABC \\sim EDC.$ If $BD = 4BC,$ that means $CD = BD - BC = 3BC.$ Therefore, the ratio of sides in $ABC$ to $EDC$ is $1:3,$ meaning the ratio of their areas is $1:9.$\n\nSince the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $6\\text{ cm}^2,$ that means the area of $\\triangle CDE$ is $\\boxed{54}\\text{ cm}^2.$"
