    "problem": "How many of the letters in MATHCOUNTS have a horizontal line of symmetry?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "We look at how many of the letters can be cut in half horizontally and are symmetrical across that line. For instance, with C, we can draw a horizontal line through it and the top and bottom halves are reflections of each other across the line. We find that only H, C, and O have a horizontal line of symmetry, so there are $\\boxed{3}$ letters."
