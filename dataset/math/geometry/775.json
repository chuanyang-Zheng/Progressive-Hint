    "problem": "In the figure below, side $AE$ of rectangle $ABDE$ is parallel to the $x$-axis, and side $BD$ contains the point $C$. The vertices of triangle $ACE$ are $A(1, 1)$, $C(3, 3)$ and $E(4, 1)$. What is the ratio of the area of triangle $ACE$ to the area of rectangle $ABDE$?

    "solution": "The area of the triangle can be expressed as $\\frac{AE \\cdot h}{2}$, where $h$ is the height of the triangle from C to AE.  However, the rectangle's area can be expressed as AE$\\cdot h$, since AB $=$ DE $= h$, thus, the ratio of the triangle's area to the rectangle's is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$."
