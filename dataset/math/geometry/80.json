    "problem": "An antacid tablet is in the shape of a right circular cylinder. The diameter of the base is $\\frac{3}{4}$ inches and the tablet is $\\frac{3}{16}$ inches thick. How many cubic inches are in the volume of the tablet? Express your answer as a common fraction in terms of $\\pi$.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The radius of the base is half the diameter or $3/8$ inches.  We plug in the given values to determine the volume of the tablet: $\\pi r^2 h = \\pi (3/8)^2 (3/16) = \\boxed{\\frac{27\\pi}{1024}}$ cubic inches."
