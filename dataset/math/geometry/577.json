    "solution": "Since $V$ is the midpoint of $PR,$ then $PV=VR.$  Since $UVRW$ is a parallelogram, then $VR=UW.$ Since $W$ is the midpoint of $US,$ then $UW=WS.$\n\nThus, $$PV=VR=UW=WS.$$ Similarly, $$QW=WR=UV=VT.$$ Also, $R$ is the midpoint of $TS$ and therefore, $TR=RS.$ Thus, $\\triangle VTR$ is congruent to $\\triangle WRS$, and so the two triangles have equal area.\n\nDiagonal $VW$ in parallelogram $UVRW$ divides the area of the parallelogram in half. Therefore, $\\triangle UVW$ and $\\triangle RWV$ have equal areas.\n\nIn quadrilateral $VRSW,$ $VR=WS$ and $VR$ is parallel to $WS.$ Thus, $VRSW$ is a parallelogram and the area of $\\triangle RWV$ is equal to the area of $\\triangle WRS.$ Therefore, $\\triangle VTR,$ $\\triangle WRS,$ $\\triangle RWV,$ and $\\triangle UVW$ have equal areas, and so these four triangles divide $\\triangle STU$ into quarters.\n\nParallelogram $UVRW$ is made from two of these four quarters of $\\triangle STU,$ or one half of $\\triangle STU.$ The area of parallelogram $UVRW$ is thus half of $1,$ or $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}.$"
