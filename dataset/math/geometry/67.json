    "problem": "An ice cream scoop scoops out ice cream spheres with radius 1 inch.  If the ice cream scoops are allowed to melt into the cone, then how many scoops are needed to fill an ice cream cone with radius 2 inches and height 5 inches?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Each ice cream sphere has volume $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi (1^3) = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi$ cubic inches.  The ice cream cone holds $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi (2^2)(5) = \\frac{20}{3}\\pi$ cubic inches.  $\\frac{\\frac{20}{3}\\pi}{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi} = 5$, so we need $\\boxed{5}$ scoops to fill the cone."
