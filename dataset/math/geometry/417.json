    "problem": "What is the area, in square units, of the square with the four vertices at $(-2, 2), (2, -2), (-2, -6)$, and $(-6, -2)$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The length of the square is $\\sqrt{4^2 + 4^2} = 4\\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, the area of the square is $(4\\sqrt{2})^2 = \\boxed{32}$."
