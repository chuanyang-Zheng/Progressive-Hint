    "problem": "How many edges does a hexagonal prism have?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "There are two bases on the prism, each with six edges, for a total of 12 base edges. Each vertex on a base is connected to a corresponding vertex on the other base, and since each base has six vertices, there are 6 vertical edges. In total, there are $12+6=\\boxed{18}$ edges."
