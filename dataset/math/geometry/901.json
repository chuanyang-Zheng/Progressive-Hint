    "problem": "From his base camp at the equator, Bruce hiked on flat terrain $13$ kilometers due north, then $24$ km due east, and finally $6$ km due south. Using a direct route, how many kilometers would Bruce be from base camp?  (Assume the Earth is flat for this problem.)",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "After travelling $13$ km north and $6$ km south, he has effectively traveled $7$ km north. In addition, he has traveled a total of $24$ km east. Applying the Pythagorean theorem, Bruce has ended up $\\sqrt{7^2+24^2} = \\boxed{25 \\, \\text{km}}$ from his origin."
