    "problem": "A cone is created by rotating an isosceles right triangle with leg length 2 about one of its legs.  Its surface area is $\\pi$ times what number?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Rotating the triangle about one of its legs produces a cone with radius 2 and height 2:  [asy]\nsize(90);\nimport solids; currentprojection = orthographic(5,0,1);\nrevolution c = cone((0,0,0), 2,2);\ndraw(c,heavycyan);\ndraw((0,0,0)--(0,2,0)--(0,0,2)--cycle);\nlabel(\"2\",(0,1,0),S); label(\"2\",(0,0,1),W);\n[/asy]\n\nThe base of the cone is a circle with radius 2, which has area $2^2\\pi=4\\pi$.\n\nWhen unrolled, the curved lateral area of the cone becomes a flat sector of a circle: [asy]\nsize(110);\ndraw(Arc((0,0),1,0,254.56),heavycyan);\ndraw(Arc((0,0),1,254.56,360),heavycyan+linetype(\"2 4\"));\ndraw((cos(4.44),sin(4.44))--(0,0)--(1,0),heavycyan);\n[/asy] The sector's radius is the cone's slant height, which, by the Pythagorean theorem, is \\[\\sqrt{2^2+2^2}=2\\sqrt{2}.\\]The sector's arc length is the cone's base perimeter, which is \\[2(\\pi)(2)=4\\pi.\\]The circle's circumference is \\[2(\\pi)(2\\sqrt{2}) = 4\\sqrt{2}\\pi,\\]so the ratio of the sector's area to the circle's area is $\\frac{4\\pi}{4\\sqrt{2}\\pi}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.  The circle's area is \\[(2\\sqrt{2})^2\\pi=8\\pi,\\]so the sector's area is \\[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\cdot 8\\pi = 4\\sqrt{2}\\pi.\\]Summing the lateral area and the base area gives a total surface area of ${4\\sqrt{2}\\pi+4\\pi}$, so its total surface area is $\\boxed{4\\sqrt{2} + 4}$ times $\\pi$."
