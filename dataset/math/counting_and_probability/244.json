    "solution": "First, suppose that the dart lands between $A$ and $B$.  It then has a probability of 1/2 of being closer to $A$ than to $B$, and it is always closer to $B$ than it is to $C$, so it is closer to $B$ than it is to $A$ and $C$ with probability 1/2.\n\nOn the other hand, if it lands between $B$ and $C$, then it is definitely closer to $B$ than to $A$, and it has a probability of 1/2 of being closer to $B$ than to $C$.  As before, it is closer to $B$ than it is to $A$ and $C$ with probability ${1/2}$.\n\n[asy]\ndefaultpen(.7);\n\ndraw((0,0)--(6,0));\nfor(int i=0;i<=6;++i){\n\ndraw((i,-.1)--(i,.1));\n\nlabel(string(i),(i,-.1),(0,-1));\n}\n\nlabel(\"\\(A\\)\",(0,0),(0,1));\nlabel(\"\\(B\\)\",(4,0),(0,1));\nlabel(\"\\(C\\)\",(6,0),(0,1));\n\ndraw((2,0)--(5,0),linewidth(3.5));\n[/asy] In either case, the probability that the dart lands closest to $B$ is 1/2, so the probability overall is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$."
