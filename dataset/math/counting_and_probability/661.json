    "problem": "What is the greatest common factor of 5!, 10!, and 15!?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Note that $5!$ divides $10!$ and $5!$ divides $15!$.  Since $5!$ has no factor larger than $5!$, and $5!$ is a factor of all three, the answer is $5!=\\boxed{120}$."
