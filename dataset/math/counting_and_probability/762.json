    "problem": "Three points are chosen randomly and independently on a circle. What is the probability that all three pairwise distances between the points are less than the radius of the circle?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We can assume that the circle has its center at $(0,0)$ and a radius of $1$. Call the three points $A$, $B$, and $C$, and let $a$, $b$, and $c$ denote the length of the counterclockwise arc from $(1,0)$ to $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively. Rotating the circle if necessary, we can also assume that $a= \\pi/3$. Since $b$ and $c$ are chosen at random from $[0, 2\\pi)$, the ordered pair $(b,c)$ is chosen at random from a square with area $4\\pi^2$ in the $bc$-plane. The condition of the problem is met if and only if \\[\n0<b<\\frac{2\\pi}{3}, \\quad 0<c<\\frac{2\\pi}{3},\n\\quad\\text{and}\\quad |b-c|<\\frac{\\pi}{3}.\n\\]This last inequality is equivalent to $b-\\dfrac{\\pi}{3}<c<b+\\frac{\\pi}{3}$.\n\n[asy]\nfill((0,0)--(0.33,0)--(0.66,0.33)--(0.66,0.66)--(0.33,0.66)--(0,0.33)--cycle,gray(0.7));\ndraw((0,0)--(2,0)--(2,2)--(0,2)--cycle,dashed);\ndraw((0,-0.33)--(1,0.66),dashed);\ndraw((-0.33,0)--(0.66,1),dashed);\ndraw((0.66,0)--(0.66,0.66)--(0,0.66),dashed);\ndraw((-0.5,0)--(2.5,0),Arrow);\ndraw((0,-0.5)--(0,2.5),Arrow);\nlabel(\"$c$\",(0,2.5),W);\nlabel(\"$b$\",(2.5,0),S);\nlabel(\"$\\frac{2}{3}\\pi$\",(0.66,0),S);\nlabel(\"$\\frac{2}{3}\\pi$\",(0,0.66),W);\nlabel(\"$2\\pi$\",(2,0),S);\nlabel(\"$2\\pi$\",(0,2),W);\n[/asy]\n\nThe graph of the common solution to these inequalities is the shaded region shown. The area of this region is \\[\n\\left(\\frac{6}{8}\\right)\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right)^2 =\n\\pi^2/3,\n\\]so the requested probability is \\[\n\\frac{\\pi^2/3}{4\\pi^2} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{12}}.\n\\]"
