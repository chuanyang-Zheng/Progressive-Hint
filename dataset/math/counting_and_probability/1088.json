    "problem": "A standard die is rolled. What is the probability that the number shown is not an even prime?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Note that the only even prime is 2. The probabilty of rolling a 2 is $\\frac{1}{6}$, so the probabilty of not rolling a 2 is $1-\\frac{1}{6} = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{6}}$."
