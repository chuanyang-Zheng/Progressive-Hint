    "problem": "Given that $x$, $\\frac{1}{x}$, $y$, $\\frac{1}{y}$, $z$ and $\\frac{1}{z}$ are all integers, how many distinct values of $x+ y+ z$ are possible?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Since $x$ and $1/x$ are integers, we know that $x$ is an integer that divides 1 evenly.  Therefore, we must have $x = -1$ or $x = 1$. The same is true for $y$ and $z$. So, the possible sums are $3(-1) = -3$, $2(-1) + 1 = -1$, $2(1) + -1 = 1$ or $3(1) = 3$. So there are $\\boxed{4}$ possible values for the sum."
