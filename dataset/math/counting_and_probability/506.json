    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Only the number of lamps on each table matters, so we can list the possibilities systematically:  \\begin{align*}\n(&10,0,0) \\\\\n& (9,1,0) \\\\\n& (8,2,0) \\\\\n& (8,1,1) \\\\\n& (7,3,0) \\\\\n& (7,2,1) \\\\\n& (6,4,0) \\\\\n& (6,3,1) \\\\\n& (6,2,2) \\\\\n& (5,5,0) \\\\\n& (5,4,1) \\\\\n& (5,3,2) \\\\\n& (4,4,2) \\\\\n& (4,3,3)\n\\end{align*}There are a total of $\\boxed{14}$ possibilities."
