    "problem": "In how many ways can 8 people be seated around a square table with 2 people on a side?  (Two configurations are considered equivalent if one is a rotation of another.)",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are $8!$ ways to place the people around the table, but this counts each valid arrangement 4 times (if you move each person 2, 4, or 6 places clockwise you get the same arrangement).  The answer is $\\dfrac{8!}{4} = \\boxed{10080}$."
