    "solution": "The number of three-point sets that can be chosen from the nine grid points is \\[\n\\binom{9}{3} = \\frac{9!}{3!\\cdot 6!} = 84.\n\\]Eight of these sets consist of three collinear points: 3 sets of points lie on vertical lines, 3 on horizontal lines, and 2 on diagonals. Hence the probability is $8/84 = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{21}}$."
