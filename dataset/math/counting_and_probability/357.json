    "problem": "In an orchestra, $60\\%$ of the musicians play string instruments, and the remainder play woodwind, brass, or percussion instruments. If the orchestra has 130 members, how many musicians do not play string instruments?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We know a person can either play a string instrument or not play a string instrument. $60\\% \\times 130 = 78$ musicians play string instruments, yielding $130-78 = \\boxed{52}$ musicians who do not play string instruments."
