    "solution": "Everything in circle $B$ is either in circle $B$, but not in circle $C$; or in both circle $B$ and circle $C$. Similarly, everything in Circle $A$ is either in circle $A$, but not in circle $B$; or in both circle $A$ and circle $B$. Additionally, everything in circle $C$ is in circle $B$ and everything in circle $B$ is in circle $A$. We are told that there are exactly 20 items in $A$ and 10 of those items are in $A$, but not in $B$. This means that there is a total of $$20-10=10$$ items in circle $B$. we are also told that there are 7 items in circle $C$. Because everything in circle $C$ is in circle $B$, we get that there are $$10-7=\\boxed{3}$$ items in circle $B$ but not in circle $C$."
