    "problem": "A standard deck of 52 cards has 13 ranks (Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King) and 4 suits ($\\spadesuit$, $\\heartsuit$, $\\diamondsuit$, and $\\clubsuit$), such that there is exactly one card for any given rank and suit.  Two of the suits ($\\spadesuit$ and $\\clubsuit$) are black and the other two suits ($\\heartsuit$ and $\\diamondsuit$) are red.  The deck is randomly arranged. What is the probability that the top two cards are both Aces?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are 4 ways to choose the first card to be an Ace, then 3 ways to choose the second card to be another Ace.  There are $52 \\times 51$ ways to choose any two cards.  So the probability is $\\dfrac{4 \\times 3}{52 \\times 51} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{221}}$."
