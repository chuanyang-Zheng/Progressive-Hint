    "problem": "Ali, Bonnie, Carlo and Dianna are going to drive together to a nearby theme park.  The car they are using has four seats: one driver's seat, one front passenger seat and two different back seats. Bonnie and Carlo are the only two who can drive the car. How many possible seating arrangements are there?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are 2 choices for the driver.  The other three can seat themselves in $3\\times 2 \\times 1 = 6$ different ways. So the number of seating arrangements is $2 \\times 6 =\\boxed{12}$."
