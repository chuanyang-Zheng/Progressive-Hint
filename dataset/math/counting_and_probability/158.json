    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We start off with $\\emph{1}$ large rectangle. Then the horizontal and vertical lines together split the large rectangle into $\\emph{4}$ smaller rectangles. In addition, the vertical line by itself splits the large rectangle into $\\emph{2}$ rectangles and the horizontal line by itself splits the large rectangle into $\\emph{2}$ other rectangles. There are $1+4+2+2=\\boxed{9}$ different rectangles in the figure."
