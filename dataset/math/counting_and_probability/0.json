    "problem": "The probability of rain tomorrow is $\\frac{1}{11}$.  What is the probability that it will not rain tomorrow?  Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "It must either rain tomorrow or not rain tomorrow, so the sum of the probability that it rains and the probability it doesn't rain is 1.  Therefore, the probability it doesn't rain is $1 - \\frac{1}{11} = \\boxed{\\frac{10}{11}}$."
