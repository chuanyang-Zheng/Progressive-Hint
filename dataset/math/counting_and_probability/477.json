    "problem": "In how many ways can 8 people sit around a round table if Pierre and Thomas want to sit together, but Rosa doesn't want to sit next to either of them? (Treat rotations as not distinct but reflections as distinct.)",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Solution 1: We choose any seat for Pierre, and then seat everyone else relative to Pierre.  There are 2 choices for Thomas; to the right or left of Pierre.  Then, there are 4 possible seats for Rosa that aren't adjacent to Pierre or Thomas. The five remaining people can be arranged in any of $5!$ ways, so there are a total of $2\\cdot 4\\cdot 5!=960$ valid ways to arrange the people around the table.\n\nSolution 2: The total number of ways in which Pierre and Thomas sit together is $6! \\cdot 2 = 1440$. The number of ways in which Pierre and Thomas sit together and Rosa sits next to one of them is $5! \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 480$. So the answer is the difference $1440 - 480 = \\boxed{960}$."
