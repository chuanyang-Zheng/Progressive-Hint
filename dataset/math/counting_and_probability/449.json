    "problem": "How many integers between 200 and 300 are perfect squares?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Let $m$ be a positive integer. $200\\le m^2\\le300\\Rightarrow 15\\le m\\le17$. Therefore, exactly $\\boxed{3}$ integers ($15^2$, $16^2$, and $17^2$) are perfect squares between 200 and 300."
