    "solution": "It takes 2 additional segments to create an additional triangle after the first. Since Figure $n$ has $n$ triangles, Figure 25 has 25 triangles. It takes 3 segments to create the first triangle and $2\\cdot24=48$ segments to create the 24 additional triangles, for a total of $3+48=\\boxed{51}$ segments."
