The combined area of those regions is 3/4, and the area of the entire square is 1, so the requested probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(2cm);\ndraw((1.1,0)--(0,0)--(0,1.1),linewidth(1));\nfill((0,0)--(1,0)--(1,1)--(0,1)--cycle,gray(0.7));\nfill((0.5,0)--(0.5,0.5)--(0,0.5)--cycle,white);\nfill((0.5,0.5)--(1,0.5)--(0.5,1)--cycle,white);\nlabel(\"$a$\",(1.1,0),E);\nlabel(\"$b$\",(0,1.1),N);\nlabel(\"1\",(1,0),S);\nlabel(\"1\",(0,1),W);\nlabel(\"0\",(0,0),SW);\n[/asy]"
