    "problem": "Given that $a$ and $b$ are real numbers such that $-3\\leq a\\leq1$ and $-2\\leq b\\leq 4$, and values for $a$ and $b$ are chosen at random, what is the probability that the product $a\\cdot b$ is positive?  Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The probability that both $a$ and $b$ are positive is $\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)=\\frac{1}{6}$. The probability that $a$ and $b$ are both negative is $\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)=\\frac{1}{4}$.  Since $ab$ is positive if and only if one of these two events occur, the probability that $ab$ is positive is $\\dfrac{1}{6}+\\dfrac{1}{4}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{12}}$.  Graphically, we can picture the possible outcomes for $(a,b)$ as a rectangle in a Cartesian plane.  The shaded rectangles are the regions in which $ab>0$.
