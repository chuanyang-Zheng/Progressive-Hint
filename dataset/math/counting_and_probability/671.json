    "solution": "For the ball to end up back in the center, the ball must deflect left 4 of the 8 times, and right the other 4 times. There are $\\binom{8}{4}$ ways to pick which 4 of the rows to deflect the ball left and then the other 4 to deflect it right.  Each deflection is to the left with probability $\\frac12$ and to the right with probability $\\frac12$, so each possible path to the bottom occurs with probability $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)^{\\!8}$.  Thus, the probability that 4 out of 8 deflections go left and the ball goes in the middle is \\[\\binom{8}{4}\\frac{1}{2^8}=\\boxed{\\frac{35}{128}}.\\]"
