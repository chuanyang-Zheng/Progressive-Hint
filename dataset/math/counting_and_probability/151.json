    "problem": "The Coventry School's European debate club has 6 German delegates, 5 French delegates, and 3 Italian delegates.  In how many ways can these 14 delegates sit in a row of 14 chairs, if each country's delegates insist on all sitting next to each other?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We first think of the German delegates forming a single German block, denoted G, the French delegates forming a single French block F, and the Italian delegates forming a single Italian block I.  Then there are $3! = 6$ ways to arrange the three blocks in a row: $$ \\text{\\textbf{\\large FGI, FIG, GFI, GIF, IFG, IGF.}} $$ Within each block, there are $6!$ ways to arrange the German delegates, $5!$ ways to arrange the French delegates, and $3!$ ways to arrange the Italian delegates.  Therefore, there are $$ 3! \\times 6! \\times 5! \\times 3! = 6 \\times 720 \\times 120 \\times 6 = \\boxed{3,\\!110,\\!400} $$ ways to seat all 14 delegates."
