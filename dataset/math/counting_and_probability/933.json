    "problem": "The first six rows of Pascal's triangle are shown below, beginning with row 0.\n\nHow many of the first 100 rows contain at least one even entry and no odd entries other than $1$? (Rows 2 and 4 have this property, for example.)\n\n\\begin{tabular}{ccccccccccc}\n&&&&&1&&&&&\\\\\n&&&&1&&1&&&&\\\\\n&&&1&&2&&1&&&\\\\\n&&1&&3&&3&&1&&\\\\\n&1&&4&&6&&4&&1&\\\\\n1&&5&&10&&10&&5&&1\\\\\n\\end{tabular}",

    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Starting with row $0$, the $k^\\text{th}$ row has the numbers \\[\\binom{k}{0},\\binom{k}{1},\\binom{k}{2},\\ldots,\\binom{k}{k} .\\]For every number in the row except the first and last values to be even, $k$ must only have even factors, so it must be a power of $2$. Since the highest power of $2$ under $100$ is $2^6=64$, $\\boxed{6}$ of the first 100 rows have only even numbers besides $1$."
