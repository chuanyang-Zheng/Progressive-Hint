    "problem": "How many positive integers are less than $100\\pi$?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Based on our knowledge of the decimal expansion of $\\pi$, we can quickly estimate that $100 \\pi \\approx 314.15$. So the largest positive integer less than $100\\pi$ is 314. Therefore, the positive integers are 1, 2, 3, $\\ldots$, 313, 314, for a total of $\\boxed{314}$ positive integers."
