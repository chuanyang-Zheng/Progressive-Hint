    "problem": "Krishanu and Shaunak each pick an integer at random between 1 and 10, inclusive. What is the probability that the product of their numbers is more than 10? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Since 10 is small for a product, we consider the complementary probability, that their product is at most 10. To do this, we count the number of ordered pairs of positive integers $(m,n)$ with $mn\\le10$ ($m$ is Krishanu's number and $n$ is Shaunak's number). If $m=1$, there are 10 such pairs; if $m=2$, there are 5; if $m=3$ there are 3; if $m=4$ or $m=5$, there are 2, and if $m=6,7,8,9,10$ there is 1, for a total of $$10+5+3+2+2+1+1+1+1+1=27$$ordered pairs with product at most 10. The probability one of these is picked is then $27/100$, since there are $10\\cdot10=100$ possible ordered pairs. Therefore, the probability that the product of their numbers is greater than 10 is $1-27/100=\\boxed{\\frac{73}{100}}$."
