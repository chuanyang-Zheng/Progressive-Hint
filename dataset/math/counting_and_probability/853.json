    "solution": "Consider the top left unit square. There are three different ways an L-shaped piece can cover that square:\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(6,0)--(6,3)--(0,3)--cycle,linewidth(2));\ndraw((0,1)--(1,1)--(1,2)--(2,2)--(2,3),linewidth(2));\n\ndraw((0,1)--(6,1));\ndraw((0,2)--(6,2));\ndraw((1,0)--(1,3));\ndraw((2,0)--(2,3));\ndraw((3,0)--(3,3));\ndraw((4,0)--(4,3));\ndraw((5,0)--(5,3));\n[/asy]\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(6,0)--(6,3)--(0,3)--cycle,linewidth(2));\ndraw((0,2)--(1,2)--(1,1)--(2,1)--(2,3),linewidth(2));\n\ndraw((0,1)--(6,1));\ndraw((0,2)--(6,2));\ndraw((1,0)--(1,3));\ndraw((2,0)--(2,3));\ndraw((3,0)--(3,3));\ndraw((4,0)--(4,3));\ndraw((5,0)--(5,3));\n[/asy]\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(6,0)--(6,3)--(0,3)--cycle,linewidth(2));\ndraw((0,1)--(2,1)--(2,2)--(1,2)--(1,3),linewidth(2));\n\ndraw((0,1)--(6,1));\ndraw((0,2)--(6,2));\ndraw((1,0)--(1,3));\ndraw((2,0)--(2,3));\ndraw((3,0)--(3,3));\ndraw((4,0)--(4,3));\ndraw((5,0)--(5,3));\n[/asy]\n\nFor the first two cases, there is only one way to place another piece to cover the lower left corner. In the last case, there is no way to place another piece to cover the lower left corner without overlapping the first piece. In both of the first two cases, the two leftmost columns will be covered. So, we can use this logic again, on the top left square which has not yet been covered. We have two choices of how to cover the first two columns, two choices of how to cover the next two columns, and two choices of how to cover the last two columns, so there are $2\\cdot2\\cdot2=\\boxed{8}$ total ways to cover the entire board."
