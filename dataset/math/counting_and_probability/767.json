    "solution": "There are only two kinds of rectangles of area 8 square units which we can form on the grid: $2\\times4$ rectangles and $4\\times2$ rectangles. For $2\\times4$ rectangles, the upper left unit square of the rectangle must be in the left three columns and top five rows, giving 15 possible locations. Similarly, there are 15 possible locations for a $4\\times2$ rectangle. Therefore, the total number of rectangles of area 8 which can be formed is $\\boxed{30}$."
