    "problem": "Two candidates, Dan and Donald, run for class president. Two other candidates, Freddie and Bernie, run for vice president. Each candidate has a 50$\\%$ chance of winning. What is the probability that both Dan and Freddie win? (Express your answer as a fraction.)",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The probability that Dan wins is $\\frac12$. The probability that Freddie wins is also $\\frac12$. Therefore, the probability that both win is $\\frac12 \\cdot \\frac12 =\\boxed{\\frac14}$."
