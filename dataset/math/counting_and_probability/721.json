    "problem": "Bin $A$ has one white ball and four black balls.  Bin $B$ has three balls labeled $\\$1$ and one ball labeled $\\$7$.  Bin $W$ has five balls labeled $\\$8$ and one ball labeled $\\$500$.  A game is played as follows: a ball is randomly selected from bin $A$.  If it is black, then a ball is randomly selected from bin $B$; otherwise, if the original ball is white, then a ball is randomly selected from bin $W$.  You win the amount printed on the second ball selected.  What is your expected win?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Since Bin $A$ has one white ball and four black balls, the money ball has a $\\dfrac{1}{5}$ chance of coming from Bin $W$ and a $\\dfrac{4}{5}$ chance of coming from Bin $B$.  The total expected value therefore is $E = \\dfrac{1}{5}E_W + \\dfrac{4}{5}E_B$, where $E_W$ and $E_B$ are the expected values of a ball drawn from bins $W$ and $B$, respectively.  Since Bin $W$ has five 8 dollar balls and one 500 dollar ball, its expected value is \\[ E_W = \\frac{5}{6}\\times\\$8 + \\frac{1}{6}\\times\\$500 = \\$90. \\]Since Bin $B$ has three 1 dollar balls and one 7 dollar ball, its expected value is \\[ E_B = \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\$1 + \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\$7 = \\$2.5. \\]Therefore \\[ E = \\frac{1}{5}E_W + \\frac{4}{5}E_B = \\frac{1}{5}(\\$90) + \\frac{4}{5}(\\$2.5) = \\boxed{\\$20}. \\]"
