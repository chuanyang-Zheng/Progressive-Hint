    "problem": "Chris wants to put six plants in a row on his windowsill. He randomly chooses each plant to be an aloe plant, a basil plant, or a violet. What is the probability that either exactly four of the plants are aloe plants or exactly five of the plants are basil plants?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "It is impossible for Chris to have both four aloe plants and five basil plants, so first we consider the case of four aloe plants. There are $\\binom{6}{4}=15$ ways to choose which of the plants are the aloe plants. For each of these choices, there is a $\\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^4 \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right) ^2$ chance of that choice happening. Therefore, the total probability that Chris chooses exactly four aloe plants is $15\\cdot\\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^4 \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right) ^2=\\frac{20}{243}$. There are $\\binom{6}{5}=6$ ways to choose five plants to be the basil plants. For each of these choices, there is a $\\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^5 \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right) ^1$ chance of that choice happening. Therefore, the total probability that Chris chooses exactly five basil plants is $6\\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^5 \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right) ^1=\\frac{4}{243}$. The probability that Chris chooses either four aloe plants or five basil plants is $\\frac{24}{243}=\\boxed{\\frac{8}{81}}$."
