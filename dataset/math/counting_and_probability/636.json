    "problem": "Pat wants to select 8 pieces of fruit to bring in the car for the people he's driving to Montana with. He randomly chooses each piece of fruit to be an orange, an apple, or a banana. What is the probability that either exactly 3 of the pieces of fruit are oranges or exactly 6 of the pieces of fruit are apples?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "It is impossible for Pat to select both 3 oranges and 6 apples, so we can calculate the probabilities of these mutually exclusive cases separately and then add to get our final answer. The probability that 3 particular pieces of fruit will be oranges and the rest will not be is given by $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)^3\\left(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\right)^5=\\dfrac{32}{6561}$, and there are $\\binom{8}{3}=56$ ways of selecting three pieces of fruit to be the oranges so the probability that 3 will be oranges is $56\\cdot\\dfrac{32}{6561}=\\dfrac{1792}{6561}$. Similarly, the probability that 6 particular pieces of fruit will be apples and the other two won't be is given by $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)^6\\left(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{4}{6561}$ and there are $\\binom{8}{6}=28$ ways of selecting which ones will be the apples, so multiplying again gives us a probability of $28\\cdot\\dfrac{4}{6561}=\\dfrac{112}{6561}$. Adding those two probabilities give us our final answer: $\\dfrac{1792}{6561}+\\dfrac{112}{6561}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1904}{6561}}$."
