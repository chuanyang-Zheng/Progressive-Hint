    "problem": "Each row of the Misty Moon Amphitheater has 33 seats.  Rows 12 through 22 are reserved for a youth club.  How many seats are reserved for this club?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are $22 - 12 + 1 = 11$ reserved rows. Because there are 33 seats in each row, there are $(33)(11) = \\boxed{363}$ reserved seats."
