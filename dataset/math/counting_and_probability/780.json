    "problem": "A bag has 4 red and 6 blue marbles.  A marble is selected and not replaced, then a second is selected.  What is the probability that both are the same color?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The probability that both marbles are red is given by: $$ P(\\text{both red}) = P(\\text{1st red}) \\times P(\\text{2nd red \\textbf{after} 1st red is drawn}). $$The probability that the first marble is red is $\\frac{4}{10}$.  After drawing a red marble, there are 3 red marbles and 9 marbles total left in the bag, so the probability that the second marble is also red is $\\frac{3}{9}$.  Therefore $$ P(\\text{both red}) = \\frac{4}{10}\\times \\frac{3}{9} = \\frac{2}{15}. $$Similarly, the probability that both marbles are blue is given by: $$ P(\\text{both blue}) = P(\\text{1st blue}) \\times P(\\text{2nd blue \\textbf{after} 1st blue drawn}). $$The probability that that the first marble is blue is $\\frac{6}{10}$.  After drawing a blue marble, there are 5 blue marbles and 9 marbles total left in the bag, so the probability that the second marble is also blue is $\\frac{5}{9}$.  Therefore $$ P(\\text{both blue}) = \\frac{6}{10}\\times \\frac{5}{9} = \\frac{1}{3}. $$Since drawing two red marbles and drawing two blue marbles are exclusive events, we add the individual probabilities to get the probability of one or the other occurring.  Therefore: \\begin{align*}P(\\text{both same color}) &= P(\\text{both red}) + P(\\text{both blue}) \\\\ &= \\frac{2}{15} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\boxed{ \\frac{7}{15}}. \\end{align*}"
