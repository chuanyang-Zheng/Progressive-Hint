    "problem": "Ten circles are all the same size. Each pair of these circles overlap but no circle is exactly on top of another circle. What is the greatest possible total number of intersection points of these ten circles?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We first note that each circle can intersect any other circle a maximum of two times.\n\nTo begin, the first circle is drawn. The second circle is then drawn overlapping the first, and two points of intersection are created. Since each pair of circles overlap (but are not exactly on top of one another), then the third circle drawn can intersect the first circle twice and the second circle twice. We continue in this manner with each new circle drawn intersecting each of the previously drawn circles exactly twice. That is, the third circle drawn intersects each of the two previous circles twice, the fourth circle intersects each of the three previous circles twice, and so on.  Diagrams showing possible arrangements for $3,$ $4,$ and $5$ circles, each giving the maximum number of intersections, are shown below.\n\n[asy]\ndraw((Circle((-6,.2),1)));\ndraw((Circle((-5,.2),1)));\ndraw((Circle((-5.5,1.2-sqrt(3)),1)));\ndraw((Circle((-2,-0.3),1)));\ndraw((Circle((-2,0.3),1)));\ndraw((Circle((-.5,-0.3),1)));\ndraw((Circle((-.5,0.3),1)));\n\ndraw((Circle((3.6,.3),1)));\ndraw((Circle((2,.3),1)));\ndraw((Circle((2.3,-0.3),1)));\ndraw((Circle((3.3,-0.3),1)));\ndraw((Circle((2.8,.8),1)));\n[/asy]\n\n\nThe resulting numbers of intersections are summarized in the table below.\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\\hline\nCircles&New intersections&Total number of intersections\\\\ \\hline\n1&0&0\\\\ \\hline\n2&2&2\\\\ \\hline\n3&$2\\times2=4$&$2+4$\\\\ \\hline\n4&$3\\times2=6$&$2+4+6$\\\\ \\hline\n5&$4\\times2=8$&$2+4+6+8$\\\\ \\hline\n6&$5\\times2=10$&$2+4+6+8+10$\\\\ \\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\nContinuing in this vein, the greatest possible total number of intersection points using ten circles is\\[2+4+6+8+10+12+14+16+18=\\boxed{90}.\\] Or, we notice that every unique pair of circles carries at most two unique intersections. There are $\\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10\\cdot 9}{2!} = 45$ different pairs of circles, which give a total of $2\\cdot 45 = \\boxed{90}$ possible intersections.\n\nTo be complete, we technically need to show that this number is possible, though we don't expect students to do this to answer the question. The diagram below demonstrates a possible positioning of the ten circles that achieves the maximum $90$ points of intersection. That is, every pair of circles intersects exactly twice and all points of intersection are distinct from one another. It is interesting to note that this diagram is constructed by positioning each of the ten circles' centres at one of the ten vertices of a suitably sized regular decagon, as shown.\n\n[asy]\ndraw((.31,-.95)--(0,0)--(.31,.95)--(1.12,1.54)--(2.12,1.54)--(2.93,.95)--(3.24,0)--(2.93,-.95)--(2.12,-1.54)--(1.12,-1.54)--cycle,linewidth(1));\ndraw((Circle((.31,-.95),2.12)));\ndraw((Circle((0,0),2.12)));\ndraw((Circle((.31,.95),2.12)));\ndraw((Circle((1.12,1.54),2.12)));\ndraw((Circle((2.12,1.54),2.12)));\ndraw((Circle((2.93,.95),2.12)));\ndraw((Circle((3.24,0),2.12)));\ndraw((Circle((2.93,-.95),2.12)));\ndraw((Circle((2.12,-1.54),2.12)));\ndraw((Circle((1.12,-1.54),2.12)));\n[/asy]"
