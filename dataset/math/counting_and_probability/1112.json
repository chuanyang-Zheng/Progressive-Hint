    "problem": "For how many ordered pairs of positive integers $(x,y)$ is $x+2y =\n100$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The value of $x=100-2y$ is a positive integer for each positive integer $y$ with $1 \\leq y \\leq 49$.  Therefore, there are $\\boxed{49}$ ordered pairs of positive integers that satisfy the equation."
