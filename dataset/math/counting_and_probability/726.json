    "problem": "The probability that a randomly thrown dart will land on a target is $\\frac{3}{8}$. What is the probability that the dart will not land on the target? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "By the notion of complementary probability, if the probability of a dart landing on the target is only $\\frac{3}{8}$, then the probability of it not landing there is $1 - \\frac{3}{8} = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{8}}$."
