    "solution": "Rewrite $x+y\\leq 4$ as $y\\leq 4-x$.  This inequality is satisfied by the points on and under the line $y=4-x$.  Sketching this line along with the $4\\times 8$ rectangle determined by the inequalities $0\\leq x\\leq 8$ and $0\\leq y\\leq 4$, we find that the points satisfying $x+y\\leq 4$ are those in the shaded triangle (see figure).  The  area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}(4)(4)=8$ square units, and the area of the rectangle is $(4)(8)=32$ square units, so the probability that a randomly selected point would fall in the shaded triangle is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$.\n\n[asy] import graph; size(200); defaultpen(linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(10));\n\ndotfactor=4;\n\nreal f(real x) { return 4-x; }\n\npair A=(0,4), B=(8,4), C=(8,0), D=(0,0); pair[] dots={A,B,C,D};\n\nfill(A--(4,0)--D--cycle,gray(0.7)); draw(A--B--C);\n\nxaxis(xmin=-3,xmax=9,Ticks(\" \",1.0, begin=false, end=false, NoZero, Size=3), Arrows(4), above=true);\n\nyaxis(ymin=-1,ymax=5,Ticks(\" \",1.0,begin=false, end=false, NoZero, Size=3), Arrows(4), above=true);\n\ndraw(graph(f,-0.8,4.5),Arrows(4)); label(\"$x+y=4$\",(-2.2,5.2));[/asy]"
