    "problem": "How many unique diagonals can be drawn in a five-sided convex polygon?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ pairs of vertices.  Five of these pairs correspond to adjacent vertices, which when connected yield edges of the pentagon.  Connecting any one of the $10-5=\\boxed{5}$ remaining pairs of vertices yields a diagonal."
