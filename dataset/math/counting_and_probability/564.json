    "problem": "Five 6-sided dice are rolled. What is the probability that exactly two of the dice show a 1 or a 2?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways to choose which of the five dice show a 1 or 2. The probability of any one of these occurring is $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{\\!2}\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^{\\!3}$. So the overall probability is $$10\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{\\!2}\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^{\\!3}=\\frac{10\\times 2^3}{3^5}=\\boxed{\\frac{80}{243}}.$$"
