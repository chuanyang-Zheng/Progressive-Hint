    "problem": "I want to read 4 books over the next month.  My bookshelf has 12 different books.  In how many ways can I choose which books to read over the next month, without regard to the order that I read them?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Order does not matter, so it is a combination. Choosing $4$ from $12$ is $\\binom{12}{4}=\\boxed{495}.$"
