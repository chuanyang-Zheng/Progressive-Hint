    "problem": "For how many three-element sets (order doesn't matter) of positive integers $\\{a,b,c\\}$ is it true that $a\\times b\\times c=2310$?  (The positive integers $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are distinct.)",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The prime factorization of $2310$ is $2310 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11.$ Therefore, we have the equation \\[ abc = 2310 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11,\\]where $a, b, c$ must be distinct positive integers and order does not matter. There are $3$ ways to assign each prime number on the right-hand side to one of the variables $a, b, c,$ which gives $3^5 = 243$ solutions for $(a, b, c).$ However, three of these solutions have two $1$s and one $2310,$ which contradicts the fact that $a, b, c$ must be distinct. Because each prime factor appears only once, all other solutions have $a, b, c$ distinct. Correcting for this, we get $243 - 3 = 240$ ordered triples $(a, b, c)$ where $a, b, c$ are all distinct.\n\nFinally, since order does not matter, we must divide by $3!,$ the number of ways to order $a, b, c.$ This gives the final answer, \\[\\frac{240}{3!} = \\frac{240}{6} = \\boxed{40}.\\]"
