    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Consider the four random points before they are labeled $A$, $B$, $C$, or $D$. In the general case, they will be distinct, forming a convex quadrilateral. Suppose $A$ is labeled. If $B$ is labeled as the vertex opposite $A$, segments $AB$ and $CD$ will intersect; otherwise, they will not. Since there are 3 points to label as $B$, the probability these segments intersect is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.
