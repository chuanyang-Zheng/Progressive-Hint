    "problem": "A singles tournament had six players. Each player played every other player only once, with no ties. If Helen won 4 games, Ines won 3 games, Janet won 2 games, Kendra won 2 games and Lara won 2 games, how many games did Monica win?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Each of the six players played 5 games, and each game involved two players. So there were $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ games. Helen, Ines, Janet, Kendra and Lara won a total of $4+3+2+2+2=13$ games, so Monica won $15-13=\\boxed{2}$ games."
