    "problem": "Annie and Xenas each arrive at a party at a random time between 2:00 and 4:00.  Each stays for 45 minutes and then leaves.  What is the probability that Annie and Xenas see each other at the party?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We let the $x$ axis represent the time Annie arrives, and the $y$ axis represent the time Xenas arrives.\n\n[asy]\ndefaultpen(.7);\n\ndraw((0,0)--(120,0), Arrow);\ndraw((0,0)--(0,120), Arrow);\nlabel(\"2:00\", (0,0), SW);\nlabel(\"2:45\", (0,45), W);\nlabel(\"3:15\", (120,75), E);\nlabel(\"2:45\", (45,0), S);\nlabel(\"4:00\", (120,0), S);\nlabel(\"4:00\", (0,120), W);\nfill((0,0)--(45,0)--(120,75)--(120,120)--(75,120)--(0,45)--cycle, gray(.7));\ndraw((120,0)--(120,120)--(0,120),dashed);\n[/asy]\n\nThe shaded region represents the times that Annie and Xenas would see each other at the party.  For example, if Annie arrived at 2:00, Xenas could arrive at any time between 2:00 and 2:45 and see Annie at the party.  Let one hour equal one unit.  Then, we can calculate the area of the shaded region as the area of the entire square minus the areas of the two unshaded triangles.  This equals $$2\\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{5}{4} \\cdot \\frac{5}{4}=\\frac{25}{16}.$$ So the area of the shaded region is $$4-\\frac{25}{16}=\\frac{64-25}{16}= \\frac{39}{16}.$$ Since the area of the square is 4, the probability that Annie and Xenas see each other at the party is $$\\dfrac{39/16}{4} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{39}{64}}.$$"
