    "solution": "We may assume that one of the triangles is attached to side $\\overline{AB}$. The second triangle can be attached to $\\overline{BC}$ or $\\overline{CD}$ to obtain two non-congruent figures. If the second triangle is attached to $\\overline{AE}$ or to $\\overline{DE}$, the figure can be reflected about the vertical axis of symmetry of the pentagon to obtain one of the two already counted. Thus the total is $\\boxed{2}$."
