    "problem": "How many ways are there to put 5 balls in 2 boxes if the balls are not distinguishable and neither are the boxes?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Since both the balls and boxes are indistinguishable, we can arrange them with 5 in one and 0 in the other, 4 in one and 1 in the other, or 3 in one and 2 in the other, for a total of $\\boxed{3}$ different arrangements."
