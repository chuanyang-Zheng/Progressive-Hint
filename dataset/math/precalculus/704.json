    "solution": "Suppose $P = (x,y,z)$ is a point that lies on a plane that bisects the angle between the planes $3x - 6y + 2z + 5 = 0$ and $4x - 12y + 3z - 3 = 0.$  (Note that there are two such bisecting planes.)  Then the distance from $P$ to both planes must be equal, so\n\\[\\frac{|3x - 6y + 2z + 5|}{\\sqrt{3^2 + (-6)^2 + 2^2}} = \\frac{|4x - 12y + 3z - 3|}{\\sqrt{4^2 + (-12)^2 + 3^2}}.\\]Then\n\\[\\frac{|3x - 6y + 2z + 5|}{7} = \\frac{|4x - 12y + 3z - 3|}{13}.\\]We want to remove the absolute value signs, in order to obtain the equation of a plane.  Checking the sign of both sides when $(x,y,z) = (-5,-1,-5)$ leads us to\n\\[\\frac{3x - 6y + 2z + 5}{7} = \\frac{4x - 12y + 3z - 3}{13}.\\]This simplifies to $\\boxed{11x + 6y + 5z + 86 = 0}.$"
