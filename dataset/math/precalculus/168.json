    "problem": "The equation $z^6+z^3+1=0$ has one complex root with argument $\\theta$ between $90^\\circ$ and $180^\\circ$ in the complex plane. Determine $\\theta,$ in degrees.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Precalculus",
    "solution": "By the sum of cubes factorization, \\[z^9 - 1 = (z^6+z^3+1)(z^3-1).\\]The roots of $z^9 - 1$ are the nine $9^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity, and the roots of $z^3 - 1$ are the three $3^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity. It follows that the roots of $z^6 + z^3 + 1$ are the six other roots of $z^9 - 1$: that is, the six $9^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity which are not $3^{\\text{rd}}$ roots of unity.\n\nThe arguments of the ninth roots of unity in the complex plane are $0^\\circ, 40^\\circ, 80^\\circ, \\dots, 320^\\circ.$\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(2 cm);\n\ndraw((-1.5,0)--(1.5,0));\ndraw((0,-1.5)--(0,1.5));\ndraw(Circle((0,0),1));\n\ndot(\"$0^\\circ$\", (1,0), NE, red);\ndot(\"$40^\\circ$\", dir(40), dir(40));\ndot(\"$80^\\circ$\", dir(80), dir(80));\ndot(\"$120^\\circ$\", dir(120), dir(120), red);\ndot(\"$160^\\circ$\", dir(160), dir(160));\ndot(\"$200^\\circ$\", dir(200), dir(200));\ndot(\"$240^\\circ$\", dir(240), dir(240), red);\ndot(\"$280^\\circ$\", dir(280), dir(280));\ndot(\"$320^\\circ$\", dir(320), dir(320));\n[/asy]\n\nThe two possible arguments that lie between $90^\\circ$ and $180^\\circ$ are $120^\\circ$ and $160^\\circ,$ but the root with argument $120^\\circ$ is a third root of unity as well. Therefore, the correct argument is $160^\\circ,$ and the answer is $\\boxed{160}.$"
