    "problem": "A particle travels along the line $y = \\frac{3}{2} x - 2.$  At time $t = 0,$ it starts at the point $(-2,-5).$   The particle then moves so that its $x$-coordinate changes at a rate of 4 units per unit of time.  Find the $y$-coordinate of the particle, as a function of $t.$",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Precalculus",
    "solution": "Since the particle starts at $(-2,-5)$ and its $x$-coordinate changes at a rate of 4 units per units of time, the $x$-coordinate is given by $x = 4t -2.$  Then\n\\[y = \\frac{3}{2} x - 2 = \\frac{3}{2} (4t - 2) - 2 = \\boxed{6t - 5}.\\]"
