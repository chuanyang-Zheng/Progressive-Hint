    "problem": "A plane passes through the points $(-5,0,0),$ $(0,2,0),$ and $(0,0,-7).$  Find the distance from the origin to this plane.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Precalculus",
    "solution": "The equation of the plane is given by\n\\[\\frac{x}{-5} + \\frac{y}{2} + \\frac{z}{-7} = 1.\\]Then from the formula for the distance between a point and a plane, the distant from the origin to this plane is\n\\[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{(-5)^2} + \\frac{1}{2^2} + \\frac{1}{(-7)^2}}} = \\boxed{\\frac{70}{39}}.\\]"
