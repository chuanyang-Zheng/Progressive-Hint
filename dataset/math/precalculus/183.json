    "problem": "Find the mid-point of the line segment with end-points $(7,-3,2)$ and $(4,1,0).$",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Precalculus",
    "solution": "To find the mid-point, we take the average of the coordinates, which works out to\n\\[\\left( \\frac{7 + 4}{2}, \\frac{-3 + 1}{2}, \\frac{2 + 0}{2} \\right) = \\boxed{\\left( \\frac{11}{2}, -1, 1 \\right)}.\\]"
