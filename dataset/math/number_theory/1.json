    "problem": "Kirsty needs to hire a plumber to fix her house. The plumber charges $242_5$ dollars for every hour of labor and $367_{8}$ dollars for equipment. If the plumber works for $3.5_{10}$ hours, how many dollars (in base ten) will Kirsty owe the plumber?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "For every hour of labor, $242_5=2\\cdot5^2+4\\cdot5^1+2\\cdot5^0=72$. For equipment, $367_{8}=3\\cdot8^2+6\\cdot8^1+7\\cdot8^0=247$. Therefore, $3.5(72)+247=\\boxed{499}$ dollars."
