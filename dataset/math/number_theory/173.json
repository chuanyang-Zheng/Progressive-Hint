    "problem": "What is the greatest three-digit integer in which the product of the digits is 6?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "$6=1\\cdot1\\cdot6=1\\cdot2\\cdot3$. To find the greatest three-digit integer the product of whose digits is 6, maximize first the hundreds digit, then the tens digit, and finally the units digit. Of the nine such integers, $\\boxed{611}$ is the greatest."
