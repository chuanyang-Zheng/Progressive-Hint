    "problem": "The word MATH is repeatedly written producing the pattern MATHMATHMATH... If the pattern is continued, what letter will occur in the 2009th position?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "If $n$ is a multiple of 4, the the $n$th letter written is H.  Therefore, the 2008th letter written is H and the 2009th letter is $\\boxed{\\text{M}}$."
