    "problem": "Let $M$ and $N$ denote the greatest and least positive two-digit multiples of 13. What is the value of $M + N$?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The least positive two-digit multiple of 13 is 13, so $N=13$. The greatest positive two-digit multiple of 13 is $7\\cdot13=91$, so $M=91$. The sum is $M+N=91+13=\\boxed{104}$."
