    "problem": "Three consecutive primes are summed. When the sum is squared, the result is 72,361. What is the largest of the three primes?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The square root of 72,361 is 269. If we divide this by 3, we will be in the ballpark of our three consecutive primes. The primes are 83, 89 and 97, so the largest is $\\boxed{97}$."
