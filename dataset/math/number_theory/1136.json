    "problem": "A base-10 integer $n$ can be represented as $32_a$ in one base and $23_b$ in another base, where $a$ and $b$ are any integer bases larger than 3. What is the smallest possible sum $a$+$b$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We start by changing the expressions to base 10 in terms of $a$ and $b$. We also know that the two expressions should be equal since they represent the same number. \\begin{align*}\n32_a&=23_b\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n3\\cdot a+2\\cdot 1&=2\\cdot b +3\\cdot1\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n3a+2&=2b+3\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n3a&=2b+1.\n\\end{align*}For the smallest sum $a+b$, we would want the smallest bases $a$ and $b$. $a$ and $b$ must be greater than 3, so we'll let $a=4$ and that means $12=2b+1$ and $b$ is not an integer. Next we try $a=5$ and that means $15=2b+1$ and $b=7$. That means our sum is $5+7=\\boxed{12}$. We can check that both expressions work: $32_5=3\\cdot5+2=17$ and $23_7=2\\cdot7+3=17$.\nAlso, it makes sense that $a=5$ works while $a=4$ does not since $3a$ must be odd for $b$ to be an integer ($3a-1=2b$ means $3a$ must be even after subtracting 1), and for $3a$ to be odd, $a$ must also be odd.\n\nAlternatively, we can just try different bases. The smallest possible value for $a$ and $b$ is 4. If we let $b=4$, we'd need a smaller base for $a$ (since we have $3\\cdot a\\approx2\\cdot b$), which isn't possible. When we let $a=4$, we get $32_4=14$ and try to find a $b$ such that $23_b=14$. That means $2b+3=14$ and $b$ is not an integer. When we let $a=5$, we get $32_5=17$ and try to find a $b$ such that $23_b=17$. If $2b+3=17$, then $b=7$ and we still get $a+b=\\boxed{12}$."
