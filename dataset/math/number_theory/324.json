    "problem": "For how many ordered pairs $(A,B)$ where $A$ and $B$ are positive integers is $AAA_7+BBB_7=666_7?$",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "For $AAA_7+BBB_7=666_7$, there must not be any borrowing involved. Thus, $A+B=6$. There are $\\boxed{5}$ ordered pairs for which this is possible, where $A$ can range from $1$ to $5$ and $B$ is $6-A$."
