    "problem": "What is the remainder of 2004 divided by 12?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "An integer is divisible by 12 if and only if it is divisible by both 3 and 4.  Because $2+0+0+4=6$ is divisible by 3, 2004 is divisible by 3.  Also, the last two digits of 2004 form a multiple of 4, so 2004 is divisible by 4 as well. Therefore, 2004 is divisible by 12 and hence leaves a remainder of $\\boxed{0}$ when divided by 12."
