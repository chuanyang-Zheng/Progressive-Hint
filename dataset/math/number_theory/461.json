    "problem": "Let $n$ be the number of integers $m$ in the range $1\\le m\\le 8$ such that $\\text{gcd}(m,8)=1$. What is the remainder when $3^n$ is divided by $8$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The subset of $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\\}$ that contains the integers relatively prime to $8$ is $\\{1,3,5,7\\}$. So $n=4$ and $3^4=9^2\\equiv 1^2=\\boxed{1}\\pmod 8$."
