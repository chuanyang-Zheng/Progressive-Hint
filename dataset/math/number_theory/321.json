    "problem": "Notice that  \\[35\\cdot40=1400.\\]Find some integer $n$ with $0\\leq n<1399$ such that $n$ is the multiplicative inverse to 160 modulo 1399.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Taking the given equation modulo 1399 gives \\[35\\cdot40\\equiv1\\pmod{1399},\\]so we know that 35 is the multiplicative inverse to 40.  We want to use this to find the multiplicative inverse to $4\\cdot40=160$, so we want to try to \"divide\" 35 by 4.\n\nThe difficulty in dividing by 4 is that 35 is odd.  We do know, though, that  \\[35\\equiv35+1399\\equiv1434\\pmod{1399}\\]and this number is even!  Let's go even further, though, to find a multiple of 4: \\[35\\equiv35+3\\cdot1399\\equiv4232\\pmod{1399}.\\]Factoring 4 we get  \\[35\\equiv4\\cdot1058\\pmod{1399}.\\]Finally we multiply by 40: \\[1\\equiv 40\\cdot35\\equiv40\\cdot4\\cdot1058\\equiv160\\cdot1058\\pmod{1399}.\\]This argument is inelegant.  Let's write it in a more clear order: \\begin{align*}\n1058\\cdot160&\\equiv1058\\cdot(4\\cdot40)\\\\\n&\\equiv(1058\\cdot4)\\cdot40\\\\\n&\\equiv35\\cdot40\\\\\n&\\equiv1\\pmod{1399}.\n\\end{align*}The multiplicative inverse to 160 modulo 1399 is $\\boxed{1058}$."
