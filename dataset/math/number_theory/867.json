    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The problem is greatly simplified by defining the sequence $C=\\{c_0,c_1,c_2,\\ldots\\}$ as $c_n=a_n+b_n$ for all nonnegative integers $n$. Then $c_0=a_0+b_0=0+1=1$ and $c_1=a_1+b_1=1+2=3$. Additionally, for integers $n>1$ we have \\begin{align*}\nc_n&=a_n+b_n\\\\\n&=(a_{n-1} +b_{n-2})+(a_{n-2} +b_{n-1})\\\\\n&=(a_{n-2}+b_{n-2})+(a_{n-1}+b_{n-1})\\\\\n&=c_{n-2}+c_{n-1}.\n\\end{align*} This is convenient since we want to determine the remainder of $a_{50}+b_{50}=c_{50}$. Thus, we no longer have to think about the sequences $A$ and $B$, but only about $C$.\n\nThe first few terms of $C$ are $1,3,4,7,11,18,29$. When reduced modulo $5$, these terms are $1,3,4,2,1,3,4$. The first four terms are $1,3,4,2$. These continue repeating $\\pmod 5$ because the next two terms are $1,3$ and all terms are defined as the sum of the preceding two. Since the cycle has length $4$ and $50\\equiv 2\\pmod 4$, we have $$c_{50} \\equiv c_2 \\pmod 5,$$ and thus $c_{50}\\equiv \\boxed{4}\\pmod 5$."
