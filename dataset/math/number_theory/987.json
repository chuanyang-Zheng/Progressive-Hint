    "problem": "Nine different two-digit numbers can be formed with the digits 1, 3 and 7. How many of these numbers are prime?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The two-digit numbers that can be formed are 11, 13, 17, 31, 33, 37, 71, 73, and 77. Of these, only 33 and 77 are composites. Thus $\\boxed{7}$ of these 9 numbers are prime."
