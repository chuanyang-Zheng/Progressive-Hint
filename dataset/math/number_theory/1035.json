    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Most of the numbers pair: \\begin{align*}\n&1-2 + 3 - 4 + 5-6+7-8+ 9 - 10\\\\\n&\\qquad=(1-2) +( 3 - 4) + (5-6)+(7-8)+ (9 - 10)\\\\\n&\\qquad=-1-1-1-1-1+11\\\\\n&\\qquad=-5+11\\\\\n&\\qquad=6.\\end{align*}The sum is 6, so the remainder when this number is divided by 8 is $\\boxed{6}$.  (The quotient is 0.)"
