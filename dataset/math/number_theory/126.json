    "problem": "The greatest common divisor of two integers is $(x+3)$ and their least common multiple is $x(x+3)$, where $x$ is a positive integer. If one of the integers is 40, what is the smallest possible value of the other one?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We know that $\\gcd(m,n) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[m,n] = mn$ for all positive integers $m$ and $n$.  Hence, in this case, the other number is \\[\\frac{(x + 3) \\cdot x(x + 3)}{40} = \\frac{x(x + 3)^2}{40}.\\] To minimize this number, we minimize $x$.\n\nThis expression is not an integer for $x =$ 1, 2, 3, or 4, but when $x = 5$, this expression is $5 \\cdot 8^2/40 = 8$.\n\nNote that that the greatest common divisor of 8 and 40 is 8, and $x + 3 = 5 + 3 = 8$.  The least common multiple is 40, and $x(x + 3) = 5 \\cdot (5 + 3) = 40$, so $x = 5$ is a possible value.  Therefore, the smallest possible value for the other number is $\\boxed{8}$."
