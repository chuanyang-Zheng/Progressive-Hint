    "problem": "If March 1 is a Monday, what day of the week will it be 270 days later?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Since there are $7$ days in a week, we first divide $270$ by $7$ to get $38 \\text{ R}4$. Therefore, there are $38$ weeks and $4$ days in $270$ days. Since it is still Monday $38$ weeks after March 1, we consider the extra four days. Four days after a Monday is a $\\boxed{\\text{Friday}}$."
