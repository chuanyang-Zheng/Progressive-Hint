    "problem": "What is the average of all positive integers that have four digits when written in base $3$, but two digits when written in base $6$? Write your answer in base $10$.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "If an integer $n$ has four digits in base $3$, then $3^3\\le n<3^4$. If an integer $n$ has two digits in base $6$, then $6^1\\le n<6^2$. The overlap of these intervals is $$\\{27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35\\}.$$The average of the integers in this set is $\\frac{27+35}{2} = \\boxed{31}$."
