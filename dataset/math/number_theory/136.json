    "problem": "When 39,500 is divided by an integer $n$, the quotient is 123 and the remainder is 17. Find $n$.",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Turning our sentence into math we have \\[39500=123n+17\\]and we want to solve for $n$.  That gives  \\[n=\\frac{39500-17}{123}=\\frac{39483}{123}=\\boxed{321}.\\]"
