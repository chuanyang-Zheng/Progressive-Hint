    "problem": "What is the sum of all of the positive factors of $36$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We find the factor pairs of 36, which are $1\\cdot36, 2\\cdot18, 3\\cdot12, 4\\cdot9, 6\\cdot6$. The sum of these factors is $1+36+2+18+3+12+4+9+6=\\boxed{91}$."
