    "problem": "If $n$ is a multiple of three, what is the remainder when $(n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8)$ is divided by $9$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We see that $(n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) = 3n + 18.$ We can see that this must be a multiple of $9,$ since $18$ is a multiple of $9$ and $3n$ is as well, since we are given that $n$ is a multiple of $3.$ Therefore, our answer is $\\boxed{0}.$"
