    "problem": "A Penteria is a special (fictional) kind of bacteria such that, regardless of the original population in a collection, the population increases by $5$ every minute. Additionally, at the end of every hour, all but the initial ones die. If $137$ Penteria are alive after $506$ minutes, how many were there at the beginning?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We have that $506\\equiv 26\\pmod {60}$, so $26$ minutes have passed in the latest hour. Let $a$ be the initial population. Then $a+26\\cdot 5=137\\implies a=137-26\\cdot 5=137-130=\\boxed{7}$."
