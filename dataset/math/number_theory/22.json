    "problem": "The two-digit number $``B6,''$ where $B$ is the tens digit, is the square of a positive integer. How many distinct possible values are there for $B$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Of the two-digit perfect squares, only $4^2=16$ and $6^2=36$ end in $6$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{2}$ distinct possible values for $B$."
