    "problem": "Solve the congruence $3n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{11}$, as a residue modulo 11.  (Give an answer between 0 and 10.)",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Note that $2 \\equiv -9 \\pmod{11}$, so we can write the given congruence as $3n \\equiv -9 \\pmod{11}$.  Since 3 is relatively prime to 11, we can divide both sides by 3, to get $n \\equiv -3 \\equiv \\boxed{8} \\pmod{11}$."
