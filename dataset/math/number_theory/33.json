    "problem": "Find an integer $n$ such that $0\\leq n<398$ and $n$ is a multiplicative inverse to 7 modulo 398.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We notice that 399 is a multiple of 7: \\[399=57\\cdot7.\\]Considering this equation modulo 398 gives \\[1\\equiv57\\cdot7\\pmod{398}\\]so the answer is $\\boxed{57}$."
