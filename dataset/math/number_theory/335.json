    "problem": "When Rachel divides her favorite number by 7, she gets a remainder of 5. What will the remainder be if she multiplies her favorite number by 5 and then divides by 7?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Let $n$ be Rachel's favorite number.  Then $n \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7}$, so $5n \\equiv 5 \\cdot 5 \\equiv 25 \\equiv \\boxed{4} \\pmod{7}$."
