    "problem": "The product of two positive whole numbers is 2005. If neither number is 1, what is the sum of the two numbers?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "$2005=5\\cdot401$. Checking the primes less than $\\sqrt{401}$ as potential divisors, we see that 401 is prime. Thus, the positive whole numbers in question are 5 and 401. Their sum is $\\boxed{406}.$"
