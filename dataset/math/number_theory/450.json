    "problem": "A two-digit integer is divisible by $n$ and its last digit is $n$. What is the greatest possible value of $n$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We are looking for the greatest possible value of the digit $n$, so let's see if $n=9$ is a possibility. 99 is divisible by 9, so the greatest possible value of $n$ is $\\boxed{9}$."
