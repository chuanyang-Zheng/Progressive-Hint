    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We have \\begin{align*}\na-b &\\equiv 62-75 \\\\\n&\\equiv -13 \\\\\n&\\equiv -13+99 \\\\\n&\\equiv 86\\pmod{99}.\n\\end{align*}This is not the answer since we want to find $n$ with $1000\\leq n<1099$.  Therefore we should add copies of 99 until we get into this range.  Since 1000 is slightly more than $990=99\\cdot10$, we begin by adding 990. \\[86\\equiv 86+990\\equiv1076\\pmod{99}.\\]That is in our range, so $n=\\boxed{1076}$."
