    "problem": "How many digits are in the whole-number representation of $10^{100}-9^{100}$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Ten to the first power has two digits, $10^2$ has three digits, $10^3$ has four digits, and so on.  Therefore, $10^{100}$ has 101 digits.  The least number with $100$ digits is $10^{99}$, which is $10^{100}-10^{99}=10^{99}(10-1)=9\\cdot 10^{99}$ less than $10^{100}$.  Since $9^{100}<9\\cdot 10^{99}$, $10^{100}-9^{100}$ is between $10^{99}$ and $10^{100}$.  Therefore, $10^{100}-9^{100}$ has $\\boxed{100}$ digits."
