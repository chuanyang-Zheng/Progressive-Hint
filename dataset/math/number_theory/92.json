    "problem": "Solve the congruence $5n \\equiv 8 \\pmod{17}$, as a residue modulo 17.  (Give an answer between 0 and 16.)",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Note that $8 \\equiv 25 \\pmod{17}$, so we can write the given congruence as $5n \\equiv 25 \\pmod{17}$.  Since 5 is relatively prime to 17, we can divide both sides by 5, to get $n \\equiv \\boxed{5} \\pmod{17}$."
