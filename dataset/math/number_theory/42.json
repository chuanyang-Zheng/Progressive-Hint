    "problem": "What is the sum of the smallest and second-smallest positive integers $a$ satisfying the congruence $$27a\\equiv 17 \\pmod{40}~?$$",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Note that $27$ and $40$ are relatively prime, so $27$ has an inverse $\\pmod{40}$. Conveniently, the inverse of $27\\pmod{40}$ is easily found to be $3$, as we have $27\\cdot 3 = 81\\equiv 1\\pmod{40}$.\n\nTo solve the congruence $27a\\equiv 17\\pmod{40}$, we multiply both sides by $3$ and simplify: \\begin{align*}\n3\\cdot 27a &\\equiv 3\\cdot 17 \\pmod{40} \\\\\na &\\equiv 51 \\pmod{40} \\\\\na &\\equiv 11 \\pmod{40}\n\\end{align*}Each operation in this sequence is reversible, so the solution set is exactly the set of integers congruent to $11\\pmod{40}$. The smallest and second-smallest positive solutions are $11$ and $51$. Their sum is $\\boxed{62}$."
