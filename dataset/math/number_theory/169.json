    "problem": "What is the greatest common factor of $20 !$ and $200,\\!000$?  (Reminder: If $n$ is a positive integer, then $n!$ stands for the product $1\\cdot 2\\cdot 3\\cdot \\cdots \\cdot (n-1)\\cdot n$.)",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The prime factorization of $200,000$ is $2^6 \\cdot 5^5$. Then count the number of factors of $2$ and $5$ in $20!$. Since there are $10$ even numbers, there are more than $6$ factors of $2$. There are $4$ factors of $5$. So the greatest common factor is $2^6 \\cdot 5^4=\\boxed{40,\\!000}$."
