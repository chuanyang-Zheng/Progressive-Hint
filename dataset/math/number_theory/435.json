    "solution": "Obviously, we have that $k > 3$, because otherwise two of the integers would be identical and not be relatively prime. Start by testing $k=4$. $6n+4$ and $6n+3$ are relatively prime because they are consecutive integers, but $6n+4$ and $6n+2$ are both even and are therefore not relatively prime. The next candidate to test is $k=5$. Firstly, we have that\n\\begin{align*}\n\\gcd(6n+5, 6n+3) &= \\gcd(6n+3, (6n+5)-(6n+3)) \\\\ &= \\gcd(6n+3, 2). \n\\end{align*}Since $6n+3$ is always odd, the two integers $6n+5$ and $6n+3$ are relatively prime.\nSecondly,\n\\begin{align*}\n\\gcd(6n+5, 6n+2) &= \\gcd(6n+2, (6n+5)-(6n+2)) \\\\&= \\gcd(6n+2, 3). \n\\end{align*}Note that $6n+3$ is always divisible by 3, so $6n+2$ is never divisible by 3. As a result, we have that $6n+5$ and $6n+2$ are relatively prime. Finally,\n\\begin{align*}\n\\gcd(6n+5, 6n+1) &= \\gcd(6n+1, (6n+5)-(6n+1)) \\\\ &= \\gcd(6n+1, 4). \n\\end{align*}Note that $6n+1$ is always odd, so $6n+5$ and $6n+1$ are also relatively prime. Therefore, the smallest positive integer $k$ that permits $6n+k$ to be relatively prime with each of $6n+3$, $6n+2$, and $6n+1$ is $k = \\boxed{5}$."
