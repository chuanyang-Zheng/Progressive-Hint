    "problem": "If $\\frac{a}{b}$ is the probability that the reciprocal of a randomly selected positive odd integer less than 2010 gives a terminating decimal, with $a$ and $b$ being relatively prime positive integers, what is $a+b$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "There are 2009 positive integers less than 2010, of which 1005 are odd. If $\\frac{1}{n}$ is equal to a terminating decimal, then $n$ can only be divisible by 2 and 5. However, since we have the added restriction that $n$ is odd, $n$ must be a power of 5. There are five powers of 5 less than 2010. \\begin{align*}\n5^0 &= 1 \\\\\n5^1 &= 5 \\\\\n5^2 &= 25 \\\\\n5^3 &= 125 \\\\\n5^4 &= 625\n\\end{align*} Note that $5^5 = 3125$. Since there are five odd integers that satisfy our desired condition, the desired probability is $\\frac{5}{1005} = \\frac{1}{201}$. This is in simplest terms, so our answer is $1+201 = \\boxed{202}$."
