    "problem": "How many positive perfect cube factors does $3^65^{10}$ have?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Any factor of $3^6\\cdot5^{10}$ is in the form $3^a\\cdot5^b$ for $0\\le a\\le6$ and $0\\le b\\le{10}$. To count the number of perfect cube factors, we must count the factors of $3^6\\cdot5^{10}$ that have $a=0$, $3$, or $6$ and $b=0$, $3$, $6$, or $9$. This gives $3\\cdot4=\\boxed{12}$ perfect cube factors."
