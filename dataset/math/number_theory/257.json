    "problem": "Cards are numbered from 1 to 100. One card is removed and the values on the other 99 are added. The resulting sum is a multiple of 77. What number was on the card that was removed?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The sum of the numbers from 1 to 100 is \\[1 + 2 + \\dots + 100 = \\frac{100 \\cdot 101}{2} = 5050.\\] When this number is divided by 77, the remainder is 45.  Therefore, the number that was removed must be congruent to 45 modulo 77.\n\nHowever, among the numbers 1, 2, $\\dots$, 100, only the number $\\boxed{45}$ itself is congruent to 45 modulo 77.  Therefore, this was the number of the card that was removed."
