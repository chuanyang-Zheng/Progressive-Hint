    "problem": "Tim is doing a cakewalk with $11$ steps. He takes his first step on step $1$ and takes a total of $139$ steps, walking in a circle (so that after the 11th step he reaches the first step again). Which step of the cakewalk does he end on?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "When you divide $139$ steps by $11$ steps, you get $12$ with a remainder of $7$. Therefore, Tim lands on step $\\boxed{7}$."
