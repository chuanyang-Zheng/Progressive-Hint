    "problem": "If $a$ and $b$ are positive integers such that $\\gcd(a,b)=210$, $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]=210^3$, and $a<b$, how many possible values are there for $a$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Note that the prime factorization of $210$ is $2\\cdot 3\\cdot 5\\cdot 7$, and so the prime factorization of $210^3$ is $2^3\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^3\\cdot 7^3$.\n\nGiven that $\\gcd(a,b)=210$ and $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]=210^3$, we must have $a=2^k\\cdot 3^\\ell\\cdot 5^m\\cdot 7^n$ and $b=2^p\\cdot 3^q\\cdot 5^r\\cdot 7^s$ where each of the ordered pairs $(k,p),(\\ell,q),(m,r),(n,s)$ is either $(1,3)$ or $(3,1)$. Therefore, if we ignore the condition $a<b$, there are independently two choices for each of $k$, $\\ell$, $m$, and $n$, and these choices determine both of the numbers $a$ and $b$. We have $2\\cdot 2\\cdot 2\\cdot 2=16$ ways to make all four choices.\n\nHowever, these $16$ sets of choices will generate each possible pair of values for $a$ and $b$ in both possible orders. Half of these choices will satisfy $a<b$ and half will satisfy $a>b$. So, imposing the condition $a<b$, we see that there are $\\frac{16}{2}=\\boxed{8}$ possible choices for $a$."
