    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We can apply the Euclidean algorithm here. \\begin{align*}\n\\gcd(13n+8, 5n+3) &= \\gcd(5n+3, (13n+8)-2(5n+3)) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(5n+3, 3n + 2) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(3n+2, (5n+3)-(3n+2)) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(3n+2, 2n + 1) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(2n+1, (3n+2)-(2n+1)) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(2n+1, n+1) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(n+1, (2n+1)-(n+1)) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(n+1, n) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(n, (n+1)-n) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(n, 1) \\\\\n&= \\boxed{1}.\n\\end{align*}"
