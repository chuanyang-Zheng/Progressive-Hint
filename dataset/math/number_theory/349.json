    "problem": "Emma plays with her square unit tiles by arranging all of them into different shaped rectangular figures. (For example, a $5$ by $7$ rectangle would use $35$ tiles and would be considered the same rectangle as a $7$ by $5$ rectangle). Emma can form exactly ten different such rectangular figures that each use all of her tiles. What is the least number of tiles Emma could have?",

    "solution": "Let $k$ be the number of tiles.  There are two cases: If $k$ has twenty divisors, then we can divide them into ten pairs, which gives us 10 ways to write $k$ as the product of two positive integers.  Alternatively, if $k$ has 19 divisors, then $k$ is a square.  So other than the square case, there are $(19 - 1)/2 = 9$ ways to write $k$ as the product of two positive integers, which gives us a total of $9 + 1 = 10$ ways.\n\nIf the prime factorization of $k$ is $p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \\dotsm p_n^{e_n},$ then the number of divisors of $k$ is\n\\[(e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\dotsm (e_n + 1).\\]Note that $e_i \\ge 1$ for each $i,$ so each factor $e_i + 1$ is at least 2.\n\nIf $k$ has 19 divisors, then $k$ must be of the form $p^{18},$ where $p$ is prime.  The smallest number of this form is $2^{18} = 262144.$\n\nOtherwise, $k$ has 20 divisors.  We want to write 20 as the product of factors, each of which are least 2.  Here are all the ways:\n\\[20 = 2 \\cdot 10 = 4 \\cdot 5 = 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 5.\\]Thus, we have the following cases:\n\n(i). $k=p^{19}$ for some prime $p.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p=2,$ which gives $k=2^{19}.$\n\n(ii). $k=pq^9$ for distinct primes $p$ and $q.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p = 3$ and $q = 2$ which gives $k=2^9\\cdot3.$\n\n(iii). $k=p^3 q^4$ for distinct primes $p$ and $q.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p = 3$ and $q = 2,$ which gives $k=2^4\\cdot3^3=432.$\n\n(iv). $k=pqr^4$ for distinct primes $p,$ $q,$ and $r.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p = 3,$ $q = 5,$ and $r = 2,$ which gives $k=2^4\\cdot3\\cdot5=240.$\n\nTherefore, the least number of tiles Emma could have is $\\boxed{240}$ tiles."
