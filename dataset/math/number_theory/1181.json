    "problem": "How many factors of $2^5\\cdot3^6$ are perfect squares?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "All factors of $2^5\\cdot 3^6$ that are perfect squares must be in the form $(2^m\\cdot 3^n)^2=2^{2m}\\cdot 3^{2n}$, where $0\\le2m\\le5$ and $0\\le2n\\le6$ for integers $m$ and $n$. Thus, $0\\le m\\le2$ and $0\\le n\\le3$, for a total of $3\\cdot4=\\boxed{12}$ factors that are perfect squares."
