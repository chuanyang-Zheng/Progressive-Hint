    "problem": "The sum of three consecutive integers is a multiple of 89 and is a value between 600 and 900. What is the sum of the three integers?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Let $n-1$, $n$, and $n+1$ be three consecutive integers. We have $(n-1)+n+(n+1)=3n=89a$ for some positive integer $a$. Since $(3,89)=1$, $a$ must be a multiple of 3, say $a=3b$ for a positive integer $b$. We must have $600\\le89\\cdot3b\\le900\\Rightarrow 600\\le267b\\le900\\Rightarrow2<b<4$. Therefore, $b=3$, which means $3n=267\\cdot3=\\boxed{801}$."
