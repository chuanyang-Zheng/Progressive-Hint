    "problem": "If 4 daps = 7 yaps, and 5 yaps = 3 baps, how many daps equal 42 baps?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Multiply $5\\text{ yaps}=3\\text{ baps}$ by 14 to find that 70 yaps are equal to 42 baps.  Then multiply $4\\text{ daps}=7\\text{ yaps}$ by 10 to find that $\\boxed{40}$ daps are equal to 70 yaps."
