    "problem": "Find $8 \\div 2 \\div 2 + 6.$",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Recall that division should be done before addition. So, we consider $8 \\div 2 \\div 2$ first. Remember that we do the division from left to right. We get \\[8 \\div 2 \\div 2 = (8 \\div 2) \\div 2 = 4 \\div 2 = 2.\\] Finally, \\[8 \\div 2 \\div 2 + 6=2+6=\\boxed{8}.\\]"
