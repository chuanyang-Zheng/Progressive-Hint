    "problem": "What is the positive difference between the greatest and least prime factors of 2000?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The prime factorization of 2000 is $2^4 \\times 5^3$ (build a factor tree if you need to see it). The greatest prime factor is 5 and the smallest prime factor is 2.  The difference is $5-2=\\boxed{3}$."
