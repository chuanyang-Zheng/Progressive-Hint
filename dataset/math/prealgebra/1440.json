    "problem": "Sallie earned a grade of exactly $90 \\%$ for a marking period based on six equally weighed tests. The four test papers she can find have grades of exactly $83 \\%$, $96 \\%$, $81 \\%$, and $82\\%$. What is the sum of the percent scores of the two missing grades?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Suppose each test is worth $x$ points.  Then on the tests Sallie found, she has a total of $.83x + .96x + .81 x + .82x = 3.42 x$ points.  In all, she earned $6\\cdot .9x = 5.4 x$ points.  Thus, on the two remaining tests she scored $1.98x$ points, which is a total of $\\boxed{198\\%}$."
