    "problem": "An equilateral triangle has a side of length 12 inches. What is the area of the triangle, in square inches? Express your answer in simplest radical form.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The area of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is $s^2\\sqrt{3}/4$. We have $s = 12$, so our area is $12^2\\sqrt{3}/4 = \\boxed{36\\sqrt{3}}$."
