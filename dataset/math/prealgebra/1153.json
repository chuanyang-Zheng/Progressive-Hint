    "problem": "Circle $A$ has a diameter of 12 inches and circle $B$ has a diameter of 22 inches. What is the ratio of the area of circle $A$ to the area of circle $B$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The ratio of the diameter of circle A to the diameter of circle B is $12/22 = 6/11$. The ratio of the areas of the two circles is the square of this ratio: $(6/11)^2 = \\boxed{\\frac{36}{121}}$."
