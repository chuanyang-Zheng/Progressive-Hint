    "problem": "A pencil costs $p$ dollars and an eraser costs $e$ dollars. Mark buys $3$ more pencils than erasers, and he buys $7$ pencils. Write an expression that represents the amount of money that Mark spent, in dollars.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Mark buys $7$ pencils, and a pencil costs $p$ dollars, so the total cost of all of the pencils is $7\\cdot p$ dollars. He buys $3$ more pencils than erasers, so he buys $4$ erasers. Each eraser costs $e$ dollars, so the total cost of all the erasers is $4\\cdot e$ dollars. Thus, Mark spent $\\boxed{7p+4e}$ dollars in total."
