    "problem": "What is the smallest possible average of four distinct positive even integers?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The smallest average will occur when the numbers are as small as possible.  The four smallest distinct positive even integers are 2, 4, 6, and 8 and their average is $\\boxed{5}$.\n\n$\\textbf{Note:}$ These numbers form an arithmetic sequence.  The average of the numbers in any arithmetic sequence is the average of the first and last terms."
