    "problem": "Hadley scored 92, 73, 79, and 87 points on the first four tests of the quarter. There is one test remaining. What is the minimum number of points that Hadley must score on the final test in order to have a mean of 80 points for the five tests?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If five scores have a mean of 80, then their sum is $80\\cdot5=400$.  Since the first four scores add up to 331, the fifth score must be at least $400-331=\\boxed{69}$."
