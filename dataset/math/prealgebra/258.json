    "problem": "Three students, with different names, line up single file. What is the probability that they are in alphabetical order from front-to-back?  Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "There are six ways to line up: $ABC$, $ACB$, $BAC$, $BCA$, $CAB$, $CBA$, and only one of these is in alphabetical order front-to-back. The probability is one in six or $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$."
