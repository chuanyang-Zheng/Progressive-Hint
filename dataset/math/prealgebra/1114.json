    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The shaded triangle has a base of length $10\\text{ cm}.$ Since the triangle is enclosed in a rectangle of height $3\\text{ cm},$ then the height of the triangle is $3\\text{ cm}.$ (We know that the enclosing shape is a rectangle, because any figure with four sides, including two pairs of equal opposite sides, and two right angles must be a rectangle.) Therefore, the area of the triangle is $$\\frac{1}{2}\\times 3 \\times 10 = \\boxed{15\\mbox{ cm}^2}.$$"
