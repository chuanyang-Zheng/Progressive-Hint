    "problem": "Find $r$ if $3(r-5)=24$.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We get rid of the 3 by dividing both sides by 3: \\[\\frac{3(r-5)}{3} = \\frac{24}{3}.\\] The 3's on the left cancel,  leaving $r-5$.  On the right we have $24/3 = 8$, so our equation is $r-5 = 8$. Adding 5 to both sides of this equation gives $r = \\boxed{13}$."
