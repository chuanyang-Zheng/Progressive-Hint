    "problem": "I have a deck of $54$ cards, and I deal all of the cards to $x$ players, with each player getting $y$ cards. If $x$ is at least $2$ and $y$ is at least $5$, then how many possible values of $x$ are there?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We want $xy=54=2 \\cdot 3^3$ such that $x$ is at least $2$ and $y$ is at least  $5$. Thus, the possible combinations $(x,y)$ are $(2,27)$, $(3,18)$, $(6,9)$, and $(9,6)$. There are $\\boxed{4}$ such combinations."
