    "problem": "What is the 17th odd positive integer?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Every odd positive integer can be expressed in the form $2x - 1$, for some integer $x$. Plugging in $x = 1$ gives $2 - 1 = 1$, which is the first odd positive integer. So the 17th odd positive integer is $2 \\cdot 17 - 1 = \\boxed{33}$."
