    "solution": "We can create a Venn diagram with circles labeled \"Black Fur\" and \"Catches Mice\". We want to find the smallest number of cats that are black but do not catch mice, so we will label this part of our Venn diagram $x$. We will also let $y$ represent the number of cats with black fur that also catch mice, and $z$ represent the number of cats that do not have black fur but do catch mice.\n\n[asy]\nsize(4cm);\nimport labelpath;\ndraw((0,-0.5)--(11,-0.5)--(11,8)--(0,8)--cycle,black+1);\nfill(Circle((4,4),3),purple+darkblue+white);\nfill(Circle((7,4),3),yellow+orange+white);\nfill(Arc((4,4),3,-60,60)--Arc((7,4),3,120,240)--cycle,purple+yellow);\ndraw(Circle((4,4),3),black+1);\ndraw(Circle((7,4),3),black+1);\nlabelpath(\"Black Fur\",Arc((4,4),4,180,315));\nlabelpath(\"Catches Mice\",Arc((7,4),4,230,360));\nlabel(\"${\\bf y}$\",(5.5,4));\nlabel(\"${\\bf z}$\",(8.3,4));\nlabel(\"${\\bf x}$\",(2.7,4));\n[/asy]\n\nWe know that there are 17 cats that don't catch mice, so there are 24-17=7 cats that do catch mice. This tells us that $y+z=7.$ There are 10 cats with black fur, so $x+y=10$. The value of $x$ will be as small as possible when the value of $y$ is as large as possible. The largest value $y$ can be is $7$, since $y+z=7$. If $y=7$, then $x$ must equal $3$.\n\n[asy]\nsize(4cm);\nimport labelpath;\ndraw((0,-0.5)--(11,-0.5)--(11,8)--(0,8)--cycle,black+1);\nfill(Circle((4,4),3),purple+darkblue+white);\nfill(Circle((7,4),3),yellow+orange+white);\nfill(Arc((4,4),3,-60,60)--Arc((7,4),3,120,240)--cycle,purple+yellow);\ndraw(Circle((4,4),3),black+1);\ndraw(Circle((7,4),3),black+1);\nlabelpath(\"Black Fur\",Arc((4,4),4,180,315));\nlabelpath(\"Catches Mice\",Arc((7,4),4,230,360));\nlabel(\"${\\bf 7}$\",(5.5,4));\nlabel(\"${\\bf 0}$\",(8.3,4));\nlabel(\"${\\bf 3}$\",(2.7,4));\n[/asy]\n\nThe smallest possible number of cats that do not catch mice and have black fur is $\\boxed{3}.$"
