    "problem": "In my neighborhood, there are six streets. There are 10 houses on each side of each street. No house faces two different streets. How many houses are in my neighborhood?",
    "level": "Level 3",

    "solution": "There are 2 sides to each street with 10 houses on each side, so there are $2\\times 10 = 20$ houses on each street. There are 6 streets in the neighborhood each with 20 houses, so there are $6 \\times 20 = \\boxed{120}$ houses in the neighborhood."
