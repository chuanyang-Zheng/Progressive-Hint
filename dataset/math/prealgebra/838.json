    "problem": "Tamantha wants to buy boxes in which to put her 77 compact discs. If each box holds 12 discs, how many does she need to buy?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Suppose Tamantha buys $n$ boxes. Since $n$ boxes will hold $12n$ discs, Tamantha will only be able to store all her discs if $12n \\ge 77$.\n\nDividing both sides of this inequality by $12$ gives $n\\ge \\frac{77}{12}$, which we can write as $n\\ge 6\\frac{5}{12}$. Tamantha can only buy a whole number of boxes, so the smallest number that will work is $\\boxed{7}$."
