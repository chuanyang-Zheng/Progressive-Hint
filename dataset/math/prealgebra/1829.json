    "problem": "What is the largest multiple of 30 which is less than 520?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Dividing 520 by 30 gives a quotient of 17 with a remainder of 10. In other words,  \\[\n520 = 30 \\cdot 17 + 10.\n\\]Thus $30\\cdot 17 = \\boxed{510}$ is the largest multiple of 30 which is less than 520."
