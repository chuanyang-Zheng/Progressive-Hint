    "problem": "What is the smallest integer $n$ such that $5n + 3 > -10$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Subtracting $3$ from both sides of the inequality gives $5n>-13$, and dividing both sides by $5$ gives $n>-\\frac{13}{5}$. Since $-\\frac{13}{5}$ is between $-\\frac{15}{5}=-3$ and $-\\frac{10}{5}=-2$, the smallest integer $n$ satisfying our inequality is $\\boxed{-2}$."
