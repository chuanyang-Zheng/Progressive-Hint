    "problem": "For how many integers $x$ do we have $\\frac14 < \\frac{x}{5} < \\frac23$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since we are looking for integer solutions, we should isolate $x$ by multiplying by 5.  This gives \\[1\\frac14<x<3\\frac13.\\]The only integers between $1\\frac14$ and $3\\frac13$ are 2 and 3.  Therefore there are $\\boxed{2}$ integers that solve this pair of inequalities."
