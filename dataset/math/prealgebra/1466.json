    "problem": "What is $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3}$?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We want to have the least common denominator, $2 \\cdot 3 = 6$, in the denominator when we add the two fractions.  We write one half as $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{3}{3} = \\frac{3}{6}$. Also, we write one third as $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{2}{2} = \\frac{2}{6}.$ Adding these, we obtain $\\frac{3}{6} + \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{5}{6}$, which is in the most simplified form. So, $$\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{6}}.$$"
