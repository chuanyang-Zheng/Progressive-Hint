    "problem": "At $2\\!:\\!48$ what is the degree measure of the smaller angle formed by the hour and minute hands of a $12$-hour clock?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We consider a hand at the 12 to be $0^\\circ$. Now we convert the hour and minute hands to a degree measure from $0^\\circ$ to $360^\\circ$. If we divide $360^\\circ$ evenly among 60 minutes, we get that each minute, the minute hand moves $\\frac{360^\\circ}{60}=6^\\circ$. So if the minute hand is at 48 minutes, it is at $48\\cdot6^\\circ=288^\\circ$.\n\nThe hour hand is a little trickier. If we divide $360^\\circ$ evenly among 12 hours, we get that each hour, the hour hand moves $\\frac{360^\\circ}{12}=30^\\circ$. Note that the hour hand is not at the 2 since it gradually moves toward the 3 throughout the hour. From the 2 toward the 3, the hour hand has moved $\\frac{48}{60}=\\frac{4}{5}$ of the way. So the degree measure of the hour hand is $2\\frac{4}{5}\\cdot30^\\circ=84^\\circ$.\n\nTo find the smaller angle formed by the two hands, we can find the larger angle $288^\\circ-84^\\circ=204^\\circ$ and subtract from $360^\\circ$ to get $\\boxed{156^\\circ}$. Or we know that $84^\\circ$ is coterminal with (ends at the same place as) $84^\\circ+360^\\circ=444^\\circ$. Now we can subtract $444^\\circ-288^\\circ=\\boxed{156^\\circ}$ to find the smaller angle."
