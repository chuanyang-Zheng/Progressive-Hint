    "problem": "What is the largest multiple of 73 less than 1000?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Note that $10\\cdot 73=730$. Counting by 73's, the next few multiples of 73 are 803, 876, and 949. The next multiple of 73 after 949 will be larger than 1000, so the largest multiple of 73 less than 1000 is $\\boxed{949}$."
