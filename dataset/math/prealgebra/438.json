    "problem": "Suppose that we roll two fair 6-sided dice.  What is the probability that the two numbers rolled sum to 4?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "There are 3 ways to roll a sum of 4: 3 on the first die and 1 on the second die, 2 on the first die and 2 on the second die, and 1 on the first die and 3 on the second die.  There are 36 total possibilities, so the probability is $\\dfrac{3}{36} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{12}}$."
