    "problem": "What is the smallest positive multiple of $13$ that is greater than $500?$",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Dividing $500$ by $13$ gives a quotient $38$ with a remainder of $6$. In other words, \\[500 \\div 13=13 \\cdot 38+6.\\]So, the smallest positive multiple of $13$ that is greater than $500$ is \\[13\\cdot39=\\boxed{507}.\\]"
