    "problem": "If each 1/2 inch on a map represents 20 miles, how many inches apart on the map are two cities whose actual distance apart is 120 miles?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since $20\\times 6=120$, we multiply 1/2 inches times 6 to get $\\boxed{3}$ inches for the distance between the cities on the map."
