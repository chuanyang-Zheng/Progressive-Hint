    "problem": "If a certain negative number is multiplied by six, the result is the  same as 20 less than the original number.  What is the value of the  original number?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Let the number be $x$. We know that $6x=x-20$. Subtracting $x$ from both sides gives $5x=-20$. Then, dividing both sides by 5 gives $x= \\boxed{-4}$."
