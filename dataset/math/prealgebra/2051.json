    "problem": "What is the area, in square units, of a square whose sides are the same length as the radius of a circle with a circumference of $12\\pi$ units?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "$C=2\\pi r$, so $12\\pi=2\\pi r$. Thus, $r=6$. The area of a square with side length 6 is $6^2=\\boxed{36} \\text{ sq units}$."
