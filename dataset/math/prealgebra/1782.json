    "problem": "Let $PQRS$ be a square piece of paper. $P$ is folded onto $R$ and then $Q$ is folded onto $S$. The area of the resulting figure is 9 square inches.

    "solution": "After folding the square twice the resulting figure is isosceles triangle with area 9 square inches. Since there are 4 such congruent triangles in the square, the area of the square is 36 square inches. Therefore, the sides of $PQRS$ are 6 inches, and the perimeter is $\\boxed{24}$ inches."
