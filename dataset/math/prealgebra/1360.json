    "problem": "The radius of a circle is 2 inches. When the radius is doubled, by how many square inches is the area increased?  Express your  answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The area of the original circle is $\\pi \\cdot 2^2=4\\pi$ square inches. After doubling the radius to $2\\cdot2=4$ inches, the area increases to $\\pi \\cdot 4^2=16\\pi$ square inches. So the increase is $16\\pi-4\\pi=\\boxed{12\\pi}$ square inches."
