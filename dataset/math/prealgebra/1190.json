    "problem": "A trapezoid has one base equal to its height, $x$, and the other base is twice as long. Write the expression for the area of the trapezoid as a common fraction in terms of $x$.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The area of a trapezoid is equal to the product of the height and the average of the length of the bases. In this case, since the length of the two bases are $x$ and $2x$ and the length of the height is $x$, the area is equal to $\\frac{x+2x}{2} \\cdot x=\\frac{3x}{2}\\cdot x=\\boxed{\\frac{3x^2}{2}}$."
