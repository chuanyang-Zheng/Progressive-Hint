    "problem": "In the NBA in 2003, Yao Ming was one of the tallest players at $7'5''$. Earl Boykins was the shortest player at $5'5''$. How many inches taller than Boykins was Ming?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The difference between $7'5''$ and $5'5''$ is exactly two feet.  Since there are twelve inches in one foot, two feet equal $2\\;\\cancel{\\text{feet}}\\times 12\\;\\dfrac{\\text{inches}}{\\cancel{\\text{foot}}} = \\boxed{24}$ inches."
