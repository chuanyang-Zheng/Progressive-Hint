    "problem": "For a world record, George Adrian picked 15,832 pounds of apples in 8 hours. Assuming he maintained a constant rate of picking, how many pounds of apples did he pick in 3 hours?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "In $\\frac{3}{8}$ as many hours, George picks $\\frac{3}{8}$ as many pounds of apples.  Therefore, George picked $\\frac{3}{8}(15,\\!832)=\\frac{3}{8}(16,\\!000-168)=3(2000)-3(21)=\\boxed{5937}$ pounds of apples in 3 hours."
