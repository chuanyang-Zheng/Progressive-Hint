    "problem": "Suppose 6 wallops = 5 ballops. Also suppose 3 ballops = 11 fallops. How many wallops are equivalent to 110 fallops?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Multiply  \\[\n3\\text{ ballops}=11\\text{ fallops}\n\\] by 10 to find that $30$ ballops are equal to $110$ fallops.  Then multiply  \\[\n6\\text{ wallops} = 5\\text{ ballops}\n\\] by 6 to find that $\\boxed{36}$ wallops are equivalent to 30 ballops."
