    "problem": "At 2:30 p.m. during a long drive, Bobbi asks her parents, ``Are we there yet?'' Her mother responds, ``We will be there in 7200 seconds.'' If Bobbi's mother is correct, at what time in the afternoon will they arrive at their destination?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Multiply 7200 seconds by $\\left(\\frac{1\\text{ min.}}{60\\text{ sec.}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1\\text{ hr.}}{60\\text{ min.}}\\right)$ to find that they will arrive in 2 hours.  Two hours after 2:30 p.m. is $\\boxed{\\text{4:30 p.m.}}$."
