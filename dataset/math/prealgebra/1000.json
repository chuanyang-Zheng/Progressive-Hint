    "problem": "What is the smallest multiple of $5$ which is greater than $-32$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Dividing $-32$ by $5$ gives $-6$ with a remainder of $-2$, or $$-32 = -6 \\cdot 5 - 2.$$Thus, $-6 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{-30}$ is the smallest multiple of $5$ that is greater than $-32$."
