    "solution": "Since all sides of a square have the same length, the perimeter of the nine-sided figure is equal to \\[ AB + AB + AB + AC + AC + AC + BC + BC + BC. \\]But we know that $AB+AC+BC=17$, the perimeter of $\\triangle ABC$.  Therefore the perimeter of the nine-sided figure is $3(17)=\\boxed{51}$."
