    "problem": "How many of the first 500 positive integers are divisible by 3, 4 and 5?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The least common multiple of 3, 4, and 5 is $3\\cdot4\\cdot5=60$, so we must find how many multiples of 60 are less than 500.  These multiples of 60 are $1\\cdot 60, 2\\cdot 60, \\ldots 8\\cdot 60$.  Thus, $\\boxed{8}$ of the first 500 positive integers are divisible by 3, 4, and 5."
