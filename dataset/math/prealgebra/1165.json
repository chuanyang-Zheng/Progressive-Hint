    "problem": "What is the smallest possible integer value of $x$ if $12\\div(x+1)$ is an integer?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "$x+1$ must be a positive or negative factor of 12. The minimum value of $x$ is achieved when $x+1$ is the most negative factor of $12$, or $-12$. Then, $x=\\boxed{-13}$."
