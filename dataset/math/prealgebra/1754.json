    "problem": "Four typists can type a total of 600 memos in three days. At that rate, how many memos can three typists type in one day?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If four typists can type 600 memos in three days, they can type 200 memos in one day. Three typists can type $3/4$ of the memos in one day, or $200\\cdot \\frac{3}{4}=\\boxed{150}$ memos."
