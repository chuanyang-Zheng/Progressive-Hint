    "problem": "The product $ab = 1200$, $a$ is an integer, and $b$ is an odd integer. What is the largest possible value of $b$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Factoring out the highest power of 2 from 1200, we find that $1200=2^4\\cdot75$. Therefore, the largest possible value of $b$ is $\\boxed{75}$."
