    "problem": "Add 313.9 to 12.6. Express the result as a decimal.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We have \\[\n\\begin{array}{@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}\n& & & 1 & \\\\\n& 3 & 1 & 3. & 9 \\\\\n+ & & 1 & 2. & 6\n\\\\ \\cline{1-5}\n& 3 & 2 & 6. & 5 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]Since $9+6=15$ in the right-most column is greater than 9, we record the 5 and \"carry\" the 10 to the next column as a 1 (shown over the second 3 in the addend 313.9). The answer is $\\boxed{326.5}$."
