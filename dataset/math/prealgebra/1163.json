    "problem": "How many numbers are in the list $ -36, -29, -22, \\ldots, 41, 48?$",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Add 1 to each member of the list to get $-35,-28,-21,\\ldots,42,49$, and divide by 7 to get $-5$,$-4$,$-3$,$\\ldots$, $6$,$7$.  Adding 6 to each number in the list gives the list $1,2,3,\\ldots,12,13$, so there are $\\boxed{13}$ numbers."
