    "problem": "What number must be placed in the box in the equation below to produce an equation that has more than one solution: \\[4x + 6 + 7x - 9 = 12x - 7 - x + \\boxed{\\phantom{2}}?\\]",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Simplifying both sides gives \\[11x - 3 = 11x - 7 + \\boxed{\\phantom{2}}.\\] Subtracting $11x$ from both sides gives \\[-3 = -7 + \\boxed{\\phantom{2}}.\\] If the number in the box is anything but 4, then the equation cannot be true, and the original equation has no solutions.  If the number in the box is $\\boxed{4}$, then the two sides of the original equation are equivalent, and all values of $x$ are solutions to the equation."
