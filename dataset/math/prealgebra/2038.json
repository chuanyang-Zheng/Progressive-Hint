    "problem": "The ratio of the measures of the angles of a triangle is 3:2:1. Given that the shortest side of the triangle is 12 meters long, what is the number of meters in the longest side of the triangle?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since the ratio of the angle measures is $3:2:1$, the angles have measures $3x$, $2x$, and $x$ for some value of $x$.  The angle measures of a triangle sum to $180^\\circ$, so we have $3x+2x+x = 180^\\circ$.  Simplifying gives $6x=180^\\circ$, so $x=30^\\circ$.  Therefore, the angle measures are $90^\\circ$, $60^\\circ$, and $30^\\circ$, which means the triangle is a 30-60-90 triangle.  In such a triangle, the hypotenuse has twice the length of the leg opposite the $30^\\circ$ angle, so the hypotenuse of the triangle in the problem has length $2\\cdot 12 = \\boxed{24}$ meters."
