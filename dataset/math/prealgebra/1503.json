    "problem": "How many integers are there on the number line between $3\\sqrt{5}$ and $5\\sqrt{3}$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We know that $3\\sqrt{5}=\\sqrt{3^2\\times5}=\\sqrt{45}$ and $5\\sqrt{3}=\\sqrt{5^2\\times3}=\\sqrt{75}$. There are only two perfect squares between 45 and 75, $7^2=49$ and $8^2=64$, so there are only $\\boxed{2}$ integers on the number line between $3\\sqrt{5}$ and $5\\sqrt{3}$."
