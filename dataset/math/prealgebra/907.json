    "problem": "A cube having the digits $1,$ $2,$ $3,$ $4,$ $5,$ $6$ on its six faces is tossed. What is the probability that the number on the top face is $5$ or $6?$",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "When the cube is tossed, the total number of possibilities is $6$ and the number of desired outcomes is $2.$ So the probability of tossing a $5$ or $6$ is $\\frac{2}{6}$ or $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}.$"
