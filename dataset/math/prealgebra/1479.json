    "problem": "Calculate $0^5 + (-1)^4$.",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Recall that 0 to any positive power is 0. Also recall that $(-a)^n=a^n$ if $n$ is even. Because 5 is positive and 4 is even, we can apply these rules to the given expression to get \\[0^5+(-1)^4=0+1^4=0+1=\\boxed{1}.\\]"
