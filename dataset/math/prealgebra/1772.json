    "problem": "Carolyn, Julie and Roberta share $\\$77$ in a ratio of 4:2:1,  respectively.  How many dollars did Carolyn receive?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The girls essentially divided the $\\$77$ into $4 + 2 + 1 = 7$ equal portions and gave 4 portions to Carolyn, 2 to Julie, and 1 to Roberta.  So each portion is worth $\\frac{\\$77}{7} = \\$ 11$.  Hence Carolyn received $11\\cdot 4 = \\boxed{44}$ dollars."
