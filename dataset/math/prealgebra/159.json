    "problem": "How many different prime factors are in the prime factorization of $117\\cdot119$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Both these numbers look like they could be primes, but are actually not. $117=3^2\\cdot13$, and $119=7\\cdot17$. That gives $\\boxed{4}$ distinct primes in the prime factorization."
