    "problem": "At 3:20, what is the degree measure of the acute angle formed by the hour hand and the minute hand on a 12-hour analog clock?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The hour hand is $\\frac{20}{60}=\\frac{1}{3}$ of the way from the 3 o'clock to the 4 o'clock position, so it has moved $\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot\\frac{1}{12}\\cdot 360^\\circ=10$ degrees past the 3 o'clock position.  The minute hand is in the 4 o'clock position, so it has moved $\\frac{1}{12}\\cdot 360^\\circ=30$ degrees past the 3 o'clock position.  The angle between the hour hand and the minute hand is $30-10=\\boxed{20}$ degrees."
