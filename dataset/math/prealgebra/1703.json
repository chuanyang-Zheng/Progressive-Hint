    "problem": "Two fair 6-sided dice are rolled.  What is the probability \"doubles\" are rolled (i.e., that the two dice show the same number)?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "There are 6 different ways to roll doubles which means the probability of rolling doubles is $\\dfrac{6}{36} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{6}}$."
