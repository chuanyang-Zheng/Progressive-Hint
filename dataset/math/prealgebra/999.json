    "problem": "What is the greatest common factor of $518$ and $294$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Factoring both numbers, we find that $518=2\\cdot 7\\cdot 37$ and $294=2\\cdot 3\\cdot 7^2$. Taking the lowest common powers of both, we see that the greatest common factor of the two numbers is $2\\cdot 7=\\boxed{14}$."
