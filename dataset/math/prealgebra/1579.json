    "problem": "What is the least positive integer divisible by the four smallest odd, positive integers?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The four smallest odd, positive integers are 1, 3, 5, and 7, so the integer must be divisible by 1, 3, 5, and 7. Since these four numbers share no factors other than 1, their least common multiple is $1\\cdot3\\cdot5\\cdot7 = \\boxed{105}$."
