    "problem": "A square has a perimeter of $28 \\text{ cm}.$ What is the area of the square, in $\\mbox{cm}^2?$",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since the four sides of a square are equal in length and the perimeter is $28,$ then each side has length $\\frac{28}{4}=7.$  The area of the square is the product of the length and width, which are each equal to $7.$ Therefore, the area of the square in $\\mbox{cm}^2$ is $7\\times7=\\boxed{49}.$"
