    "problem": "The owners of a house that is assessed at $\\$120,\\!000$ pay $\\$3,\\!000$ in taxes. At the same rate, what is the tax, in dollars, for a house assessed at $\\$160,\\!000$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The value of the $\\$160,\\!000$ house is $\\frac{4}{3}$ of the value of the $\\$120,\\!000$ house, so the tax is $\\frac{4}{3}$ as great as well: $\\$3,\\!000\\cdot\\frac{4}{3}=\\boxed{\\$4,\\!000}$."
