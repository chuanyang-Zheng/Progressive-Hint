    "problem": "What is the sum of the median and the mean of the set of numbers 12, 21, 6, 11 and 30?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "In order, the numbers are 6, 11, 12, 21, and 30, so the median is 12. The mean is $(6 + 11 + 12 + 21 + 30)/5 = 80/5 = 16$. The sum of these two numbers is $\\boxed{28}$."
