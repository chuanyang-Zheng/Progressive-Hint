    "problem": "A bookcase has 3 shelves with a total of 24 books. The top shelf has 8 mystery books. The middle shelf has 10 math books. The bottom shelf has 6 science books. Two books are now taken off each shelf. What fraction of the books remaining on the three shelves are math books? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Six books are removed from the shelves, so $24-6=18$ books remain.  Of these, $10-2=8$ are math books.  Therefore, $8/18=\\boxed{\\frac{4}{9}}$ of the books remaining are math books."
