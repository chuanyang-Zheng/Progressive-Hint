    "problem": "A class of 30 students recently took a test.  If 20 students scored 80, 8 students scored 90, and 2 students scored 100, then what was the class average (the mean) on this test?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "From the given information, the total amount of marks obtained by the class is   $$20(80)+8(90)+2(100)=2520.$$Therefore, the class average is  $$\\frac{2520}{30} = \\boxed{84}.$$"
