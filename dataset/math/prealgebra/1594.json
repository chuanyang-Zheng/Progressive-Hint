    "problem": "What is the measure of the acute angle formed by the hands of a clock at 4:20 a.m.?  Express your answer as number of degrees.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "As the minute hand moves $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the way around the clock face from 12 to 4, the hour hand will move $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the way from 4 to 5.  So the hour hand will move $\\frac{1}{3}$ of $\\frac{1}{12}$ of $360^\\circ$, or $\\boxed{10^\\circ}$."
