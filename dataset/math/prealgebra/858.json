    "problem": "What is the least common multiple of 51, 68 and 85?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "$51=3\\cdot17$, $68=2^2\\cdot17$, and $85=5\\cdot17$. Taking the highest present power of each prime, we find the LCM to be $2^2\\cdot3\\cdot5\\cdot17=\\boxed{1020}$."
