    "problem": "Dawn has $\\$ $1.20 in nickels, dimes and quarters. For each nickel she has one dime and for each dime she has one quarter. How many total coins does she have?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If Dawn has $x$ nickels, then she has $x$ dimes and $x$ quarters. In cents, we set up an equation for how much money she has. \\begin{align*}\n5x+10x+25x&=120\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n40x&=120\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\nx&=3\n\\end{align*} She has $3$ of each coin for a total of $\\boxed{9}$ coins."
