    "problem": "Multiply $\\frac{2}{3}$ by $\\frac{4}{7}$.",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Recall that if $b$ and $d$ are nonzero, then  \\[\n\\frac{a}{b}\\cdot \\frac{c}{d} = \\frac{ac}{bd}.\n\\]In other words, to multiply fractions we just multiply numerators and multiply denominators. The product of the given numerators is $2\\cdot 4=8,$ and the product of the given denominators is $3\\cdot 7=21$. So the product of $\\frac{2}{3}$ and $\\frac{4}{7}$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{8}{21}}$."
