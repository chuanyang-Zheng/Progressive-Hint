    "problem": "The sum of a whole number and the next four consecutive whole numbers is $105$. Find the result when the mean of the numbers is subtracted from the median of the numbers.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Let the given whole number be $x$. The sequence contains five numbers $x,x+1,x+2,x+3,x+4$. Obviously, the mean and the median are both $x+2$, so that their difference is $\\boxed{0}$."
