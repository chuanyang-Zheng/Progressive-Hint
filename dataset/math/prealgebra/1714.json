    "problem": "Quadrilateral $ABCD$ is a parallelogram. If the measure of angle $A$ is 62 degrees and the measure of angle $ADB$ is 75 degrees, what is the measure of angle $ADC$, in degrees?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since adjacent angles of a parallelogram add up to $180^{\\circ}$, $ADC=180^{\\circ}-A=180^{\\circ}-62^{\\circ}=\\boxed{118^{\\circ}}$."
