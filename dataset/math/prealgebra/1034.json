    "problem": "Dave's sister baked $3$ dozen pies of which a third contained chocolate, a quarter contained marshmallows, a sixth contained cayenne, and one twelfth contained salted soy nuts.  What is the smallest possible number of pies that had none of these ingredients?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "She baked 36 pies.  Of these\n\n$\\bullet$ $\\frac13\\cdot36=12$ contained chocolate\n\n$\\bullet$ $\\frac14\\cdot36=9$ contained marshmallows\n\n$\\bullet$ $\\frac16\\cdot36=6$ contained cayenne\n\n$\\bullet$ $\\frac1{12}\\cdot36=3$  contained salted soy nuts.\n\n\n\nIn order to make the number of pies with none of these ingredients as small as possible, Dave's sister should put all of these ingredients in different pies so that only one of the ingredients is in any pie.  If she does this, then  \\[12+9+6+3=30\\] of the pies will have one of these ingredients.  The other 6 pies will have none of these ingredients.  At least $\\boxed{6}$ pies have none of these ingredients."
