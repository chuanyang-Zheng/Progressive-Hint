    "problem": "What is the least common multiple of $14$, $20$, and $35$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The prime factorizations of the integers are $2\\cdot7$, $2^2\\cdot5$, and $5\\cdot7$. In the prime factorizations, the highest powers of distinct factors are $2^2$, $5$, and $7$, so the least common multiple is $2^2\\cdot5\\cdot7=\\boxed{140}$."
