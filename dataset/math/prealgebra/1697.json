    "problem": "Alicia's average on her five tests is 88 points. The score range for each test is 0 points to 100 points, inclusive. What is the lowest possible score that Alicia could have earned on one of the five tests?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If Alicia's average score on her five tests is 88 points, then the sum of her scores must be $88 \\times 5 = 440$ points. If she earned   100 points on four of the tests, then she could have earned a score as low as $\\boxed{40\\text{ points}}$ on the other test."
