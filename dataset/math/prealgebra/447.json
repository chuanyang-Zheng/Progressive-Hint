    "problem": "Two concentric circular regions have radii of 1 inch and 10 inches. What is the area, in square inches, outside the smaller region, but inside the larger region? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The area of the inner circle is $\\pi$. The area of the outer circle is $100\\pi$. Thus, subtracting $\\pi$ from $100\\pi$, we get $\\boxed{99\\pi \\text{ square inches}}$."
