    "problem": "Sharon bought a mixture of nuts that was made up of pecans, walnuts and cashews in a ratio by weight of $2:3:1$, respectively. If she bought $9$ pounds of nuts, how many pounds of walnuts were in the mixture? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since the pecan to walnut to cashew ratio is $2:3:1$, it follows that the walnut ratio to all of the nuts is equal to $\\frac{3}{2+3+1} = \\frac 12$. Thus, there were $\\frac 12\\times 9 = \\boxed{4.5}$ pounds of walnuts in the mixture."
