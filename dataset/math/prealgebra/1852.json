    "problem": "At 3:20, what is the measure in degrees of the lesser angle formed by the hour hand and the minute hand?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "At 3:20, the minute hand is at the 4, $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the way around the clock, therefore, $120$ degrees from the top.  The hour hand, at the beginning of the hour, started at the 3, but since we are $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the way through the hour, the hour hand will have traveled $\\frac{1}{3}$ the arc from 3 to 4.  Therefore, the hour hand is another 10 degrees further clockwise, meaning the measure of the angle between the two hands is $120 - 100 = \\boxed{20\\text{ degrees}}$."
