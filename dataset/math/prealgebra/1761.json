    "problem": "Remmy wants to divide $10$ by $\\frac{2}{3}$, but he cannot remember how to do that.  By what number should he multiply $10$ to get the answer?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Remember that dividing by a fraction is the same thing as multiplying by the reciprocal of the fraction.  The reciprocal of $\\frac{2}{3}$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$, so that is what Remmy should multiply by."
