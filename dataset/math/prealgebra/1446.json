    "problem": "What is the largest multiple of 37 which is less than 800?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Dividing 800 by 37 gives a quotient of 21 with a remainder of 23. In other words,  \\[\n800 = 37 \\cdot 21 + 23.\n\\]Thus $37\\cdot 21 = \\boxed{777}$ is the largest multiple of 37 which is less than 800."
