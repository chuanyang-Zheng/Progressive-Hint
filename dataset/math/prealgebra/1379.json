    "problem": "What is the sum of all positive integers $t$ such that $1.2t \\leq 9.6$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Dividing both sides of the inequality by 1.2, we have $t \\le \\dfrac{9.6}{1.2}$. The right side of this inequality is equal to $\\dfrac{96}{12}$, which is $8$.\n\nThus, we are looking for the sum of all positive integers less than or equal to $8$. This is $1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8 = \\boxed{36}$."
