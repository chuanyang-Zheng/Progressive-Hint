    "problem": "The arithmetic mean of eight positive integers is 7. If one of the eight integers is removed, the mean becomes 6. What is the value of the integer that is removed?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If the mean of the eight integers is 7, then the sum of those eight integers is $8 \\cdot 7=56$. If the mean of the seven remaining numbers is 6, then the sum of those numbers is $7 \\cdot 6=42$. Thus, the removed number is $56-42=\\boxed{14}$"
