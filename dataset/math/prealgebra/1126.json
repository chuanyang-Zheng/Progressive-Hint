    "problem": "If a certain number is multiplied by five, the result is the  same as twenty-one plus twice the original number.  What is the value of the original number?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Let the number be $x$. We know that $5x=2x+21$. Subtracting $2x$ from both sides gives $3x=21$. Then, dividing both sides by 3 gives $x=\\boxed{7}$."
