    "problem": "What is the value of $x$ in the equation $3x + 2 + 3(1+x) = 23$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Expanding and collecting like terms on the left hand side gives $6x+5=23$. Subtracting 5 from both sides gives $6x=18$. Then, dividing both sides by 6 gives $x=\\boxed{3}$."
