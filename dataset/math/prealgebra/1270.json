    "problem": "Anna has 7 peaches and Dana has 9 peaches. Both of them divide their peaches up into meals. Anna divides her 7 peaches into 20 meals of equal size. Dana divides his peaches evenly into meals of 0.36 peaches per meal. Who has larger meals?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Anna's meals are each $\\frac{7}{20}$ peaches. Converting this into a decimal, we need to multiply the numerator and denominator by 5. Doing so, we get \\[\\frac{7}{20} \\cdot \\frac{5}{5} = \\frac{7 \\cdot 5}{20 \\cdot 5} = \\frac{35}{100} = 0.35\\]Because 0.35 < 0.36, $\\boxed{\\text{Dana}}$ has larger meals."
