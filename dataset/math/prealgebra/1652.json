    "problem": "A chocolate chip cookie recipe calls for 15 cups of flour for 20 dozen cookies. How many cups of flour are needed for 144 cookies?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Converting 144 to 12 dozen, we see that we are making $\\frac{12}{20}=\\frac{3}{5}$ as many cookies as the recipe makes.  Therefore, we need $\\frac{3}{5}$ as much flour, which is $\\frac{3}{5}\\cdot15=\\boxed{9}$ cups."
