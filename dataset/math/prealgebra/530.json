    "problem": "What is the least common multiple of all positive integers smaller than 8?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We write out the prime factorization of all natural numbers smaller than 8: \\[1, \\: 2, \\: 3, \\: 2^2, \\: 5, \\: 2 \\cdot 3, \\: 7.\\]Multiplying the highest power of each prime number together yields a desired least common multiple of $2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 = \\boxed{420}$."
