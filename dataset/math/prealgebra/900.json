    "problem": "A domino consists of two congruent squares placed side by side. The perimeter of the domino is 60 units. What is the area of the domino, in square units?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Suppose that the domino's short side measures $l$ units.  Then it's long side measures $2l$ units, and the domino's total perimeter is $6l = 60$.  Thus $l = 10$ and the domino's area is $10\\cdot 20 = \\boxed{200}$ square units."
