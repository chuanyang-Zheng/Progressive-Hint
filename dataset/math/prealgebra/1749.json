    "problem": "At the chocolatier, classic chocolate fudge costs 10 dollars a pound. Anna purchases $\\frac{7}{9}$ of a pound of the fudge. The cash register rounds to the nearest cent, or hundredth of a dollar. How many dollars does Anna pay for her fudge?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The actual cost of the fudge Anna purchases is\n\\begin{align*} \\frac{7}{9}\\cdot 10 &= 0.\\overline{7}\\cdot 10\\\\ &= 7.\\overline{7}\\\\ &= 7.777\\ldots \\end{align*}To round to the nearest hundredth, we must look at the thousandths place, which here is 7. Since 7 is greater than or equal to 5, we round the hundredths place, which in $7.\\overline{7}$ is 7, up to 8. So, rounding $7.\\overline{7}$ to the nearest hundredth yields $\\boxed{7.78}$ dollars."
