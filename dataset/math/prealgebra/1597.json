    "problem": "Suppose that $x$ is a multiple of 6 (not necessarily positive). If the square of $x$ is less than 200, how many possible values of $x$ are there?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The multiples $-12, -6, 0, 6,$ and 12 all have squares less than 200, for a total of $\\boxed{5}$ possible values. Since $18^2$ is bigger than 200, the squares of all the other multiples of $x$ are greater than 200. (Recall that the square of a negative number is positive)."
