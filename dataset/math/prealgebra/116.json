    "solution": "Because angle $QBP$ measures 14 degrees, we know that angle $ABC$ measures $3\\cdot14=42$ degrees.  Hence, angle $ACB$ measures $180 - 39 - 42 = 99$ degrees.  Next we find that angle $BCP$ measures $\\frac{99}3=33$ degrees, and finally angle $BPC$ measures $180 - 14 - 33 = \\boxed{133}$ degrees."
