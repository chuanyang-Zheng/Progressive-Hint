    "problem": "The data in the table below shows the percent of bus riders in a survey of Central H.S. students; 300 males and 300 females in each grade were surveyed. For which grade is the number of its male bus riders closest to $135\\%$ of the number of its female bus riders? \\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}\\hline\nGrade & Males & Females \\\\ \\hline\n$9^{\\mathrm{th}}$ grade & $41.1\\%$ & $39.4\\%$ \\\\ \\hline\n$10^{\\mathrm{th}}$ grade & $34.4\\%$ & $33.1\\%$ \\\\ \\hline\n$11^{\\mathrm{th}}$ grade & $20.6\\%$ & $13.8\\%$ \\\\ \\hline\n$12^{\\mathrm{th}}$ grade & $11.6\\%$ & $8.6\\%$ \\\\ \\hline\n\\end{tabular}",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The grade level in which the number of male bus riders is closest to $135\\%$ of the number of female bus riders is the same grade level in which the percentage of male bus riders is closest to $135\\%$ of the percentage of female bus riders. To find what percentage is $135\\%$ of the percentage of female bus riders, we multiply each percentage by $1.35.$ In ninth grade, the percentage is $39.4\\cdot1.35=53.19$ percent. In tenth grade, the percentage is $33.1\\cdot1.35=44.685$ percent. In eleventh grade, the percentage is $13.8\\cdot1.35=18.63$ percent. In twelfth grade, the percentage is $8.6\\cdot1.35=11.61$ percent. From inspection, we see that $135\\%$ of the percentage of female bus riders in twelfth grade is closest to the percentage of male bus riders in twelfth grade. So the answer is $\\boxed{12}.$"
