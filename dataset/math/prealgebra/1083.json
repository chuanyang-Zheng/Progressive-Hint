    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We take the average of these six scores: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{70 + 80 + 90 + 75 + 80 + 85}{6} &= \\frac{(70 + 90) + 80 + 80 + (75 + 85)}{6}\\\\\n&= \\frac{(80 + 80) + 80 + 80 + (80 + 80)}{6}\\\\\n&= \\frac{6\\cdot 80}{6}\\\\\n&= \\boxed{80}.\n\\end{align*}"
