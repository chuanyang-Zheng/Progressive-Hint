    "problem": "A woman 5-feet tall casts an 8-foot shadow. At the same time of day, the shadow of a tree nearby is 120 feet long. In feet, how tall is the tree?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The ratio of the height of an object to the length of its shadow is a constant at a given time of day.  Therefore,  \\[\n\\frac{5}{8}=\\frac{h}{120},\n\\]where $h$ is the height of the tree. Since $8\\times15=120$, $h=5\\times15=\\boxed{75}$ feet."
