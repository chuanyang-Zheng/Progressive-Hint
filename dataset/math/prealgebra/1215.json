    "problem": "The difference between two prime numbers is 17. What is their sum?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "All primes besides 2 are odd.  If we subtract two odd numbers, our result will always be even.  Hence, one of our two primes is 2.  If $x$ is the other prime number, we have that $x-2 = 17$, meaning that $x+2 = 17 + 2\\cdot 2 = \\boxed{21}$."
