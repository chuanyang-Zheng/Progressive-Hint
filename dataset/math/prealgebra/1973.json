    "problem": "A bicycle is traveling at 20 feet per minute. What is the bicycle's speed expressed in inches per second?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "There are $12$ inches in a foot, so the bicycle is traveling at $12(20)=240$ inches per minute.  There are $60$ seconds in a minute, so the bicycle is traveling at $\\frac{240}{60}=\\boxed{4}$ inches per second."
