    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Multiplying all expressions in our chain of inequalities by $5$, we have $$\\frac{10}{3} < x < \\frac{30}{7}.$$ Writing this in terms of mixed numbers, we have $$3\\frac13 < x < 4\\frac27.$$ The only integer $x$ satisfying this chain of inequalities is $\\boxed{4}$."
