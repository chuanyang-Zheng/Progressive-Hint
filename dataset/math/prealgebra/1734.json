    "problem": "Stacey is standing in a field. She walks 11 meters west, 30 meters north, 4 meters west and finally 22 meters south. How many meters is she from her starting point?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Stacey walks $11+4=15$ meters west in total, and she walks a net of $30-22=8$ meters north.  By the Pythagorean theorem, she is $\\sqrt{8^2+15^2}=\\boxed{17\\text{ meters}}$ from her starting point."
