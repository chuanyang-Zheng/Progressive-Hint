    "problem": "For what integer $x$ is $\\frac 35 < \\frac x7 < \\frac 79$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Multiplying by 7, we have $\\frac{21}{5}<x<\\frac{49}{9}$. Note that $\\frac{21}{5}$ is between $\\frac{20}{5}=4$ and $\\frac{25}{5}=5$, while $\\frac{49}{9}$ is between $\\frac{45}{9}=5$ and $\\frac{54}{9}=6$.  Thus, the only integer between $\\frac{21}{5}$ and $\\frac{49}{9}$ is $\\boxed{5}$."
