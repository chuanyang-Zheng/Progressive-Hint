    "problem": "Find $\\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{2}{9}$.",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The least common denominator of these two fractions is 9, so we must rewrite $\\frac{1}{3}$ with 9 on the bottom. We can rewrite one third as $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{3}{3} = \\frac{3}{9}$.  Then, we have $\\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{3}{9} - \\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{3-2}{9} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{9}}$."
