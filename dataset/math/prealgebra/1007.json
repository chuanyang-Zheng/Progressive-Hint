    "problem": "A housefly sits on the outer edge of a rotating circular ceiling fan with a diameter of 6 feet. The fan rotates constantly at a rate of 20 revolutions per minute. How many minutes had the housefly been on the fan during the time it took to travel $19{,}404\\pi$ feet? Express your answer to the nearest whole number.",

    "solution": "A ceiling fan with a diameter of 6 feet has a circumference of $6\\pi$ feet. If the fly traveled $19{,}404\\pi$ feet, then it must have made $19{,}404\\pi \\div 6\\pi = 3234$ revolutions. Since the fan rotates 20 times per minute, that's $3234 \\div 20 = 161.7$ minutes, or about $\\boxed{162\\text{ minutes}}$, to the nearest whole number."
