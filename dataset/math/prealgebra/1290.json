    "problem": "Newton High School is selling bag lunches for a field trip.  The price of $3$ lunches is given to be $\\$4.50$. Tyler wants to know if he can afford to buy himself and $4$ of his friends lunch.  If the price of each lunch is fixed, how much money does Tyler need?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since $3$ lunches sell for $\\$4.50$, each lunch sells for $\\frac{\\$4.50}{3}=\\$1.50$.  Thus the total cost of $5$ lunches is $5 \\times \\$1.50=\\boxed{\\$7.50}$."
