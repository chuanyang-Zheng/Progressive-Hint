    "problem": "The arithmetic mean of 7, 2, $x$ and 10 is 9. What is the value of $x$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If those 4 numbers average to 9, they must sum to $4\\times 9 = 36$.  Then, we simply subtract the other three numbers from 36: $36 - 7 - 2 - 10 = \\boxed{17} = x$."
