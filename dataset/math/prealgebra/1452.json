    "problem": "What is the value of $x$ in the equation $2x + \\frac{1}{2}x + 2(1+x) = 29$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Collecting like terms on the left hand side gives $\\frac{9}{2}x+2=29$. Subtracting 2 from both sides gives $\\frac{9}{2}x=27$. Then, multiplying both sides by $\\frac{2}{9}$ gives $x=\\boxed{6}$."
