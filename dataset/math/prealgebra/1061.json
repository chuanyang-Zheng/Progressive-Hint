    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The positive factors of $12$ are $1, 2, 3, 4, 6,$ and $12$. The negative factors of $12$ are $-1, -2, -3, -4, -6,$ and $-12$. When we add these twelve numbers together, we can pair each positive factor with its negation: \\begin{align*}\n[1+(-1)] + [2 + (-2)] + [3 + (-3)]& + [4 + (-4)] \\\\\n{}+ [6 + (-6)] + [12 + (-12)] &= 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 \\\\\n&= \\boxed{0}.\n\\end{align*}"
