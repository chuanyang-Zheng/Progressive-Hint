    "problem": "The ratio of Mary's age to Alice's  age is  $3:5$. Alice is 30 years old. How many years old is Mary?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Multiplying both parts of $3:5$ by 6 gives gives $3:5 = 3\\cdot 6:5\\cdot 6 = 18:30$. Therefore, if Alice is 30 years old, then Mary is $\\boxed{18}$ years old."
