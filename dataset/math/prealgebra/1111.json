    "problem": "How many positive even perfect cubes are less than 2008?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since $0^3 < 1 < 2^3$ and $12^3 < 2008 < 13^3$, we have the list $2^3,4^3,6^3,\\ldots,12^3$, which has the same number of elements as $2,4,6,\\ldots,12$, which has $\\boxed{6}$ elements."
