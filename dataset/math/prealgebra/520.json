    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Notice that the two fractions have the same denominator, so we can add them. Addition is commutative, so we can rearrange the terms to get  \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{k-3}{2} +\\frac{3k+1}{2}+3k+1 &=\\frac{4k-2}{2}+3k+1 \\\\\n&=2k-1+3k+1 \\\\\n&=\\boxed{5k}.\\end{align*}"
