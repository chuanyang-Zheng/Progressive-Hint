    "problem": "Estimate $14.7923412^2$ to the nearest hundred.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We know $14^2=196$ and $15^2=225.$ So both $14^2$ and $15^2,$ estimated to the nearest hundred, are 200. Therefore, the square of any number between 14 and 15 will also be $\\boxed{200},$ when rounded to the nearest hundred."
