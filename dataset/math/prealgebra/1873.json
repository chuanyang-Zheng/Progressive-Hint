    "problem": "The circumference of Earth is 40,000 kilometers. How many trips around Earth could you take if you travel one billion meters?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "First, convert one billion meters to kilometers.\n\n\\[1000000000 \\textnormal{ meters} \\cdot \\frac{1 \\textnormal{ kilometer}}{1000 \\textnormal { meters}} = 1000000 \\textnormal{ kilometers}\\]\n\nNext, we divide the total distance traveled by the circumference around the Earth to get the total number of trips around the world, or $\\frac{1000000}{40000} = \\boxed{25}$ trips."
