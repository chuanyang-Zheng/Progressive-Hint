    "problem": "Square tiles measuring 4 inches on each side will be used to tile a 1-foot by 1-foot area. How many of these tiles are needed?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "A 1-foot by 1-foot area is 12 inches by 12 inches. Thus, there need to be three tiles on each side of this area. The total number of tiles is then $3\\cdot3=\\boxed{9}$ tiles."
