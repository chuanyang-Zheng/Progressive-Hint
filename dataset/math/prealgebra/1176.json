    "problem": "On my ping-pong team there are four times as many right-handed boys as left-handed boys.  Of the students on the team who are left-handed, there are twice as many girls as there are boys.  Half of the girls who are on the team are left-handed.  If there are 36 people on the team, how many are right-handed boys? (Assume no player plays ping-pong equally well with both hands.)",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Let the number of left-handed boys be $x$.  Since there are four times as many right-handed boys, the number of right-handed boys is $4x$.  Since there are twice as many left-handed girls as left-handed boys, and there are $x$ left-handed boys, there are $2x$ left-handed girls.  We place all of this in a Venn diagram:\n\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.05cm);\nlabel(\"Left-Handed\", (2,74));\nlabel(\"Boys\", (80,74));\ndraw(Circle((30,45), 22));\ndraw(Circle((58, 45), 22));\nlabel(\"$x$\", (44, 45));\nlabel(\"Neither (right-handed girls)\",(44,10));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$2x$\",(28,45));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$4x$\",(63,45));\n[/asy]\n\nWe also know that half the girls on the team are left-handed.  Since there are $2x$ left-handed girls, there are also $2x$ right-handed girls.\n\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.05cm);\nlabel(\"Left-Handed\", (2,74));\nlabel(\"Boys\", (80,74));\ndraw(Circle((30,45), 22));\ndraw(Circle((58, 45), 22));\nlabel(\"$x$\", (44, 45));\nlabel(\"Neither (right-handed girls): $2x$\",(44,10));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$2x$\",(28,45));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$4x$\",(63,45));\n[/asy]\n\nThere are a total of  \\[36=2x+x+4x+2x=9x\\]people on the team, so $x=4$.  We are trying to find the number of right-handed boys.  This number is  \\[4x=4\\cdot4=\\boxed{16}.\\]"
