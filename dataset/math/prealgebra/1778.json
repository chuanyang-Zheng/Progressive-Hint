    "problem": "In a certain amount of time, a plane traveling at a constant $250$ miles per hour traveled $20,\\!000$ feet.  In this same amount of time, how many feet would a plane traveling at a constant $400$ miles per hour travel?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We know that the ratio of the speeds of the planes will be equal to the ratio of the distances that each travels.  Since the ratio of the speed of the faster plane to that of the slower one is $\\frac{400}{250}$, the distance that the faster plane travels is $20,\\!000 \\times \\frac{400}{250}=\\boxed{32,\\!000}$ feet.\n\nAnother way to do this problem is to use the formula Distance = Rate $\\times$ Time. We would use this formula to find, using the information of the first plane, the exact amount of time it took to travel $20,\\!000$ feet. Then using this new information we would again apply the formula, this time for the second plane, to find the answer.  This approach, however, is more complicated and requires conversion between units (feet to miles and vice versa)."
