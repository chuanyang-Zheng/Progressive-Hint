    "problem": "What is $35.2 + 49.3$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Write $35.2$ as $35 + 0.2$, and $0.2 = 2 \\cdot 10^{-1}$.  Similarly, $49.3 = 49 + 0.3$, and $0.3 = 3 \\cdot 10^{-1}$.  Adding these two decimals, we have $(35 + 2 \\cdot 10^{-1}) + (49 + 3 \\cdot 10^{-1})$, which can be regrouped as $(35 + 49) + (2 \\cdot 10^{-1} + 3 \\cdot 10^{-1})$.  Simplifying, we have $84 + 5 \\cdot 10^{-1} =\\boxed{84.5}$."
