    "solution": "Since $50\\%$ selected chocolate and $10\\%$ selected strawberry as their favorite flavor, then overall $50\\%+10\\%=60\\%$ chose chocolate or strawberry as their favorite flavor. Now $$60\\% = \\frac{60}{100}=\\frac{3}{5},$$so $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}$ of the people surveyed selected chocolate or strawberry as their favorite flavor."
