    "problem": "Find the ratio of the circumference of a circle with radius 1.125 to the circumference of a circle with diameter 2.25. Express your answer in the form $a:b$ where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If a circle has diameter $2.25$, then its radius must be half of that which is $1.125$. Thus, both circles have radius $1.125$, so their circumferences must be equal and in a ratio of $\\boxed{1:1}$."
