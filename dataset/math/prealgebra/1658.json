    "problem": "Ten more than five times a number equals five more than ten times the number. What is the number?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If the number is $x$, then we have  $5x+10=10x+5$.  Subtracting 5 and $5x$ from both sides gives $5=5x$, so $x=\\boxed{1}$."
