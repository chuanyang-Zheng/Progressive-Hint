    "problem": "Enrico makes a list of the first twenty positive multiples of 3. Marie makes a list of the first ten positive multiples of 6. How many of the numbers on Marie's list are also on Enrico's list?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Enrico's list includes all the multiples of 3 from $1 \\cdot 3 = 3$ through $20 \\cdot 3 = 60$. Marie's list includes all the multiples of 6 from $1 \\cdot 6 = 6$ through $10 \\cdot 6 = 60$. Since 6 is a multiple of 3, any multiple of 6 is also a multiple of 3. All of the numbers on Marie's list are multiples of 3 within the range of Enrico's list, so all $\\boxed{10}$ numbers on Marie's list are also on Enrico's list."
