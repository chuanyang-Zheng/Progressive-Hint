    "problem": "What is the 1000th digit to the right of the decimal point when $\\frac{4}{15}$ is expressed as a decimal?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Using long division, we find that $\\frac{4}{15}=0.2\\overline{6}$. Therefore, every digit to the right of the decimal point besides the $2$ in the tenths place will be $6$. The 1000th digit to the right of the decimal point is $\\boxed{6}$."
