    "problem": "In BINGO, a $5\\times5$ card is filled by marking the middle square as WILD and placing 24 other numbers in the remaining 24 squares.\n\n\nSpecifically a card is made by placing 5 numbers from the set $1-15$ in the first column, 5 numbers from $16-30$ in the second column, 4 numbers $31-45$ in the third column (skipping the WILD square in the middle), 5 numbers from $46-60$ in the fourth column and 5 numbers from $61-75$ in the last column.\n\nOne possible BINGO card is:\n\n[asy]\nfor (int i=0; i<6;++i) {\ndraw((i,0)--(i,5));\ndraw((0,i)--(5,i));\n}\nlabel(\"$1$\",(.5,0.5));\nlabel(\"$2$\",(.5,1.5));\nlabel(\"$3$\",(.5,2.5));\nlabel(\"$4$\",(.5,3.5));\nlabel(\"$5$\",(.5,4.5));\n\nlabel(\"$20$\",(1.5,0.5));\nlabel(\"$19$\",(1.5,1.5));\nlabel(\"$18$\",(1.5,2.5));\nlabel(\"$17$\",(1.5,3.5));\nlabel(\"$16$\",(1.5,4.5));\n\nlabel(\"$31$\",(2.5,0.5));\nlabel(\"$32$\",(2.5,1.5));\nlabel(\"Wild\",(2.5,2.5));\nlabel(\"$34$\",(2.5,3.5));\nlabel(\"$35$\",(2.5,4.5));\n\nlabel(\"$50$\",(3.5,0.5));\nlabel(\"$49$\",(3.5,1.5));\nlabel(\"$48$\",(3.5,2.5));\nlabel(\"$47$\",(3.5,3.5));\nlabel(\"$46$\",(3.5,4.5));\n\nlabel(\"$71$\",(4.5,0.5));\nlabel(\"$72$\",(4.5,1.5));\nlabel(\"$73$\",(4.5,2.5));\nlabel(\"$74$\",(4.5,3.5));\nlabel(\"$75$\",(4.5,4.5));\n\n[/asy]\n\nTo play BINGO, someone names numbers, chosen at random, and players mark those numbers on their cards.  A player wins when he marks 5 in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n\nHow many distinct possibilities are there for the values in the diagonal going from top left to bottom right of a BINGO card, in order?",

    "solution": "The middle square is WILD, so we do not need to consider it in our count.\n\nThere are 15 choices for the first number.  Since the second number cannot be equal to the first number, there are also 15 choices for the second number.  Likewise, there are 15 choices for the third and fourth numbers.  Therefore there are  \\[15^4=\\boxed{50,\\!625}\\]total choices for this diagonal."
