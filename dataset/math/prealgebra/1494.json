    "problem": "Let $x=\\frac{7}{8}$ and $y=-\\frac{2}{9}$.  If $x\\cdot z = y$, then what is $z$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Plug in the values of $y$ and $x$, we have $\\frac{7}{8} \\cdot z = -\\frac{2}{9}$.  Dividing both sides by $\\frac{7}{8}$, we have $z = \\frac{-\\frac{2}{9}}{\\frac{7}{8}}$.  Since division is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal, $x = -\\frac{2}{9} \\cdot \\frac{8}{7} = \\frac{-2\\cdot8}{9\\cdot7}$ = $\\boxed{-\\frac{16}{63}}$."
