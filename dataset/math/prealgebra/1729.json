    "problem": "There are 16 tablespoons in a cup. A recipe for 4 people uses 1 tablespoon of garlic powder. How many cups of garlic powder does it take to make the same recipe for 80 people? Express your answer as a mixed number.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Our ratio of garlic powder to people served is $\\frac{1 \\textnormal{ tablespoon}}{4 \\textnormal{ people}}$. We multiply this ratio by 80 people to get the number of tablespoons needed to serve 80 people, which is $\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 80 = 20$ tablespoons. Converting this to cups, we have $20 \\textnormal{ tablespoons} \\cdot \\frac{1 \\textnormal{ cup}}{16 \\textnormal{ tablespoons}} = \\boxed{1\\frac{1}{4}}$ cups."
