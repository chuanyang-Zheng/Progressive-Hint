    "problem": "If $3 \\times 11 \\times 13 \\times 21 = 2005 +b$, what is the value of $b$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "To multiply the left-hand side quickly, we note that among the 4 numbers, we have $11 \\times 13 \\times 7 = 11 \\times 91 = 1001$.  Then, we have 9 left over, so the total product is 9009, and subtracting 2005, we get $\\boxed{7004}$."
