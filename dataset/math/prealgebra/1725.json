    "problem": "For what value of $x$ is the following equation true: $3000 + x - 2000 = 1500 + 1000$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We can first simplify the equation to $1000 + x = 2500$. Subtracting $1000$ from both sides gives $x+1000-1000=2500-1000$. Therefore, we know $x=\\boxed{1500}$."
