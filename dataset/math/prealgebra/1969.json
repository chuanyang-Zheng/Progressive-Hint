    "problem": "A consumer report revealed the following information about three tubes of toothpaste. Bright is $60 \\%$ more expensive than Fresh and has $25\\%$ less volume than Glow. Glow is $25\\%$ less expensive than Bright and has $33\\frac{1}{3} \\%$ more volume than Fresh. Fresh costs $\\$1.00$ per unit of volume. What is the number of cents per unit of volume of Glow?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Make a table to organize the information about the cost and the volume of the three tubes of toothpaste.  Let the number of units of volume in one tube of Fresh be $u$.  Then the cost of one tube of Fresh is $\\$u$.  Since Bright is more expensive than Fresh by $60\\%$, one tube of Bright costs $\\$\\,\\frac{8}{5}u$.  Also, since Glow has $33\\frac{1}{3}\\%$ more volume than Fresh, the volume of a tube of Glow is $\\frac{4}{3}u$ units.   \\[\n\\begin{array}{c|cc}\n& \\text{volume} & \\text{cost} \\\\ \\hline\n\\text{Bright} & & \\$\\,\\frac{8}{5}u \\\\\n\\text{Fresh} & u & \\$\\,u\\\\\n\\text{Glow} & \\frac{4}{3}u &\n\\end{array}\n\\]Finally, multiply the volume of Glow by $\\frac{3}{4}$ to find the volume of Bright, and multiply the cost of Bright by $\\frac{3}{4}$ to find the cost of Glow. \\[\n\\begin{array}{c|cc}\n& \\text{volume} & \\text{cost} \\\\ \\hline\n\\text{Bright} & u & \\$\\,\\frac{8}{5}u \\\\\n\\text{Fresh} & u & \\$\\,u\\\\\n\\text{Glow} & \\frac{4}{3}u & \\$\\,\\frac{6}{5} u\n\\end{array}\n\\]Dividing the cost of a tube of Glow by its volume, we find a cost-per-unit-volume of $\\$\\frac{6}{5}u\\div \\frac{4}{3}u=\\$\\frac{9}{10}=\\boxed{90}$ cents."
