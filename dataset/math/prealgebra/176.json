    "problem": "What is the smallest possible product of one one-digit prime and two distinct two-digit primes?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The smallest possible product is formed by the smallest one-digit prime and the two smallest two-digit primes.  The smallest one-digit prime is 2, and the two smallest two-digit primes are 11 and 13.  Their product is $2 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 = \\boxed{286}$."
