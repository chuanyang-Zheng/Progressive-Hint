    "problem": "What is the area, in square units, of a circle with a circumference of $8\\pi$ units? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Setting the expression $2\\pi r$ for the circumference of the circle equal to $8\\pi$ and dividing by $2\\pi$, we find that the radius of the circle is $r=4$.  The area of the circle is $\\pi r^2=\\pi(4)^2=\\boxed{16\\pi}$ square units."
