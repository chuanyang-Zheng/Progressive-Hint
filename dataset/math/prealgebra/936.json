    "problem": "The measures of the angles of a triangle are in a ratio of $3:5:7$. What is the degree measure of the largest angle?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Let $3k$ be the measure of the smallest angle.  Then the other two angles measure $5k$ and $7k$.  Since the interior angles of a triangle sum to 180 degrees, we have $3k+5k+7k=180^\\circ$, which implies $k=180^\\circ/15=12^\\circ$.  The largest angle is $7k=7(12^\\circ)=\\boxed{84}$ degrees."
