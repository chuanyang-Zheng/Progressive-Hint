    "problem": "In 1992, a scoop of gelato could be purchased in Italy for 1200 lire. The same gelato would have cost $\\$1.50$ in the U.S. At the equivalent exchange rate between the lire and the dollar, how many dollars would be equivalent to 1,000,000 lire?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Multiply both sides of $1200\\text{ lire}=\\$1.50$ by $1,\\!000,\\!000/1200$ to find that one million lire equals $\\frac{3}{2}\\cdot10,\\!000/12=\\boxed{1250}$ dollars."
