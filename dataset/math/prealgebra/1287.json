    "problem": "On December $17,$ $1903,$ at Kitty Hawk, N.C., the $1903$ Wright Flyer became the first powered, heavier-than-air machine to achieve controlled, sustained flight with a pilot aboard.\n\n\\begin{tabular}[t]{|l|c|c|c|}\n\\multicolumn{4}{c}{\\textbf{December 17, 1903 Flights}}\\\\\\hline\n&\\textbf{Pilot}&\\textbf{Time in Flight}&\\textbf{Distance}\\\\\\hline\n\\textbf{First Flight}&Orville&$12$~seconds&$37$~meters\\\\\\hline\n\\textbf{Longest Flight}&Wilbur&$59$~seconds&$260$~meters\\\\\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\nThe average speed for the first flight was $x$ meters per second. The average speed for the longest flight was $y$ meters per second. What is the average of $x$ and $y?$ Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The average speed is defined as distance of flight divided by time in flight. Thus, $x$ is equal to $$\\frac{37 \\text{ meters}}{12 \\text{ seconds}} \\approx 3.083 \\frac{\\text{m}}{\\text{s}}$$ and $y$ is equal to $$\\frac{260 \\text{ meters}}{59 \\text{ seconds}} \\approx 4.407 \\frac{\\text{m}}{\\text{s}}.$$ The average of $x$ and $y$ is defined as $$\\frac{x+y}{2}\\approx\\frac{3.083+4.407}{2}=3.745.$$ Rounding the answer to the nearest tenth, we have $\\boxed{3.7}.$"
