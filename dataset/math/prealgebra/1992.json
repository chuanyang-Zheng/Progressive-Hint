    "problem": "A piece of yarn is $60$ cm long. The yarn is cut so that one piece is five times the length of the other piece. How many centimeters long is the shorter piece?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If the shorter piece has length $x$, then the longer piece has length $5x$. We require that $x + 5x = 6x = 60$.  Thus, $x = \\boxed{10}$ cm."
