    "problem": "What is the least, positive four-digit multiple of 7?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Dividing 1000 by 7 gives a quotient of 142 and a remainder of 6. From this calculation we can see that $142\\cdot 7$ is the largest three-digit multiple of 7. Therefore, $143\\cdot 7=\\boxed{1001}$ is the least positive four-digit multiple of 7."
