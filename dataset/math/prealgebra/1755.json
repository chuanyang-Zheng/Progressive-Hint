    "problem": "How many different combinations of $\\$5$ bills and $\\$2$ bills can be used to make a total of $\\$17$?  Order does not matter in this problem.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since the total $\\$17$ is odd, there must be an odd number of $\\$5$ bills.  One $\\$5$ bill plus six $\\$2$ bills is a solution, as is three $\\$5$ bills plus one $\\$2$ bill.  Five $\\$5$ bills exceeds $\\$17$, so these are the only $\\boxed{2}$ combinations that work."
