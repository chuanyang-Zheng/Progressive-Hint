    "problem": "Let $\\boxed{N}$ mean the number of whole number divisors of $N$. For example, $\\boxed{3}=2$, because $3$ has two divisors, $1$ and $3.$ Find the value of \\[\\boxed{\\boxed{11}\\times\\boxed{20}}\\]",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Both $1$ and $11$ divide $11,$ so $\\boxed{11}=2$, and since $1,$ $2,$ $4,$ $5,$ $10,$ and $20$ divide $20,$ then $\\boxed{20}=6$. The inner expression, $\\boxed{11}\\times\\boxed{20}=2\\times6=12$. Finally, $\\boxed{12}=6$ because $1,$ $2,$ $3,$ $4,$ $6,$ and $12$ divide $12.$\n\nTherefore, $6$ is our answer. Please note that we have not boxed the correct answer as we normally do, as that would be especially confusing for this problem."
