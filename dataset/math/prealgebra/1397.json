    "problem": "Two fair 6-sided dice are rolled.  What is the probability the sum rolled is 9?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "There are 4 different ways to roll a 9 (3+6, 4+5, 5+4, 6+3), which makes the probability of rolling a 9 equal to $\\dfrac{4}{36} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{9}}$."
