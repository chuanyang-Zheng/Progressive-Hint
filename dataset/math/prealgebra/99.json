    "problem": "A right triangle has two sides of length $6$ units each.  What is the area of the triangle, in square units?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The two lengths of 6 units must be the two bases of the right triangle, because the hypotenuse in a right triangle must be longer than each base. Thus, the area of the triangle is $\\frac{6\\cdot6}{2}=\\boxed{18}$ square units."
