    "problem": "How many positive integers less than 103 have an odd number of positive divisors?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The only positive integers that have an odd number of positive divisors are perfect squares, so the only positive integers less than 103 that have an odd number of positive divisors are $1, 4, 9, \\ldots, 100$.  There are $\\boxed{10}$ of these numbers."
