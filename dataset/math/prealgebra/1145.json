    "problem": "Simplify the following expression. $$[(1\\cdot2)+(3\\cdot4)-(5\\cdot6)+(7\\cdot8)]\\cdot(9\\cdot0)$$",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Rather than being distracted by the calculations in the first set of brackets, note that everything is multiplied by $(9\\cdot 0) = 0$. Thus, the expression simplifies to $\\boxed{0}$."
