    "problem": "What is the product of $0.\\overline{05}$ and $1.8$ expressed as a fraction in simplest form?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "First let's convert $0.\\overline{05}$ to a fraction. Let's define $x=0.\\overline{05}$. If we multiply both sides by $100$ we get $100x=5.\\overline{05}$ so $99x=5$ and $x=0.\\overline{05}=\\frac{5}{99}$. Since $1.8=\\frac{9}{5}$ we get  $$\\frac{\\cancel{5}}{99}\\cdot\\frac{9}{\\cancel{5}}=\\frac{9}{99}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{11}}.$$"
