    "problem": "In parallelogram $PQRS$, the measure of angle $P$ is five times the measure of angle $Q$. What is the measure of angle $R$, in degrees?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Consecutive angles in a parallelogram are supplementary, while opposite angles are equal.  So $P + Q = 180 = 5Q + Q$, implying that $Q = 30$.  Thus $P = \\boxed{150} = R$, and we are done."
