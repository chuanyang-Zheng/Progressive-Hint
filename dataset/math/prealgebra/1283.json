    "problem": "What is the greatest digit that can be placed in the circle so that the six-digit number is divisible by 4? $$3\\:5\\:2\\:9 \\bigcirc 2$$",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Using the divisibility rule for 4, the six-digit number will be divisible by 4 if the number formed by the last two digits is divisible by 4. Of the two-digit numbers ending in 2, only 12, 32, 52, 72, and 92 are divisible by 4. Thus the greatest digit is $\\boxed{9}$."
