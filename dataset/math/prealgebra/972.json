    "problem": "What is the positive difference between the greatest and the least member of the set $\\left\\{\\frac{3}{7},\\frac{4}{3},\\frac{11}{8},\\frac{6}{16}\\right\\}$? Express your answer in simplest form.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The least member of the set is either $\\frac{3}{7}$ or $\\frac{6}{16}$, since these two members are the only ones smaller than 1. Since $\\frac{3}{7}=\\frac{6}{14}$, $\\frac{6}{16}$ is the smaller of the two. The greatest member is either $\\frac{4}{3}$ or $\\frac{11}{8}$. Since $\\frac{4}{3}=\\frac{32}{24}$ and $\\frac{11}{8}=\\frac{33}{24}$, $\\frac{11}{8}$ is the larger of the two. Thus, the desired difference is $\\frac{11}{8}-\\frac{6}{16}=\\frac{22}{16}-\\frac{6}{16}=\\boxed{1}$."
