    "problem": "Emily has a bag which contains only blue and green marbles.  She knows that the ratio of green marbles to blue marbles in the bag is $3$ to $1$ and that the bag contains a total of $60$ marbles.  How many of the marbles in the bag are blue?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since the ratio of green to blue marbles is $3$ to $1$, this means that for every $3$ green marbles there is $1$ blue marble and thus only $1$ out of every $4$ marbles in the bag is blue.  Thus the total number of blue marbles in the bag is $\\frac{1}{4} \\times 60=\\boxed{15}$"
