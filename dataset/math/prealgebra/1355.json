    "problem": "What is the remainder when the product of the $5$ smallest prime numbers is divided by $42$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The product of the $5$ smallest prime numbers is $2\\cdot 3\\cdot 5\\cdot 7\\cdot 11$, while $42=2\\cdot 3\\cdot 7$. Since the prime factorization of $42$ is included in the product $2\\cdot 3\\cdot 5\\cdot 7\\cdot 11$, the former divides the latter perfectly, leaving remainder $\\boxed{0}$."
