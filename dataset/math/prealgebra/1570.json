    "problem": "Five is added to four times an integer to get a result of 277. What was the integer?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Let the integer be $n$.  Then five more than four times $n$ is equivalent to the expression: $$5+4n$$We know the result of this was 277, so we can set up the equation: \\begin{align*}\n5+4n&=277 \\\\\n4n&=272 \\\\\nn&=68.\n\\end{align*}So, the integer was $\\boxed{68}$."
