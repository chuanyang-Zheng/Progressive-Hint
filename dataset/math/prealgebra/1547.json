    "solution": "Raising 42 to powers could get really messy really quickly, so let's avoid substituting immediately, and see if there is a way to simplify the expression first.\n\nRecall that $\\left( \\frac{1}{x} \\right)^n=\\frac{1}{x^n}$, so we can rewrite $\\left(\\frac{1}{a}\\right)^4$ as $\\frac{1}{a^4}$. Thus, we have  \\[\\frac{1}{a^4} \\cdot 2 \\cdot a^4+a^{2+1-3}.\\]Because multiplication is commutative, we can rearrange the terms to get  \\[2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{a^4} \\cdot a^4+a^{2+1-3}.\\]Any nonzero number times its reciprocal is 1, so this can be simplified to \\[2 \\cdot 1 +a^{2+1-3}.\\]Simplifying the numbers in the exponent of $a$, we find that it simplifies to $a^0$. Because any number to the zero power is 1, this simplifies to 1. Thus, we have \\begin{align*}\n2 \\cdot 1 +a^{2+1-3} &=2 + a^0 \\\\\n&=2+1 \\\\\n&=\\boxed{3}.\n\\end{align*}"
