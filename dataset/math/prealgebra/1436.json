    "problem": "In the land of Ink, the money system is unique. One Trinket is equal to 4 Blinkets, and 3 Blinkets are equal to 7 Drinkets. In Trinkets, what is the value of 56 Drinkets?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Multiply  \\[\n3\\text{ Blinkets}=7\\text{ Drinkets}\n\\] by 8 to find that 24 Blinkets are equivalent to 56 Drinkets.  Multiply  \\[\n1\\text{ Trinkets}=4\\text{ Blinkets}\n\\] by 6 to find that $\\boxed{6}$ Trinkets are equivalent to 24 Blinkets (which in turn are equivalent to 56 Drinkets, as we just found)."
