    "problem": "In the North Area Mall, 18 of the 90 stores sell shoes. If that same ratio holds true for the University Mall and 9 stores there sell shoes, how many stores are at University Mall?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The ratio of shoe stores to all stores is $18:90$.  Dividing both parts of this ratio by 2 gives  \\[\\text{shoe stores}:\\text{all stores} = 18:90 = 9:45,\\] so if there are 9 shoe stores, then there are $\\boxed{45}$ stores total."
