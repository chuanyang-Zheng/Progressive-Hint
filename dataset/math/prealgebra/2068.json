    "problem": "How many inches are in $2 \\frac{1}{6}$ yards?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since there are 3 feet in a yard, there are $3\\cdot12=36$ inches in a yard. That means in $2\\frac{1}{6}$ yards there are $36\\cdot(2\\frac{1}{6})=36(\\frac{13}{6})=\\boxed{78}$ inches."
