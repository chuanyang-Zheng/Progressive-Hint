    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We consider the separate cases by the dimensions of each type of rectangle. There are 7 of the $1 \\times 1$ squares. There are 4 vertical $1 \\times 2$ rectangles, and 4 horizontal $1 \\times 2$ rectangles. There are also 1 each of vertical and horizontal $1 \\times 3$ rectangles. And, finally, there are the two $2 \\times 2$ squares. In total, there are $7 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 2 = \\boxed{19}$ rectangles."
