    "problem": "A number is selected at random from 1 through 100, inclusive.  What is the probability that the number is a divisor of 50? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "There are 100 numbers possible between 1 and 100. There are 6 divisors of 50: 1,2,5,10,25,50.  So the probability that a randomly selected number is a divisor of 50 is $\\dfrac{6}{100} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{50}}$."
