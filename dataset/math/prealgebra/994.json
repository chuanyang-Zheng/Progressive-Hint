    "problem": "Bobby stands 10 feet from Sam, and Eric stands 8 feet from Bobby. What is the least number of feet that Eric could be from Sam?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Eric is on the circle of radius $8$ centered at Bobby.  The closest point on this circle to Sam is where it intersects the line segment between Bobby and Sam. If Eric is on this line segment, the minimum of $10-8=\\boxed{2}$ feet is obtained."
