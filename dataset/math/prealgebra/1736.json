    "solution": "The area of the ring between the two largest circles is $$\\pi\\cdot 13^2-\\pi\\cdot 12^2=169\\pi - 144\\pi=25\\pi.$$Suppose that the radius of the smallest circle is $r.$ Thus, the area of the smallest circle is $\\pi r^2.$ Since the area of the smallest circle is equal to the area of the ring between the two largest circles, then $\\pi r^2 = 25\\pi$ so $r^2 = 25$ and so $r=5$ since $r>0.$\n\nTherefore, the radius of the smallest circle is $\\boxed{5}.$"
