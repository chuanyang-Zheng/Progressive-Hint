    "problem": "Mary completes a 15-mile race in 2.5 hours. What is her average speed in miles per hour?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Average speed is total distance divided by time.  In this case, we divide 15 miles by $2\\frac{1}{2}$ hours to find an average speed of $15\\div \\frac{5}{2}=15\\cdot \\frac{2}{5}=\\boxed{6}$ miles per hour."
