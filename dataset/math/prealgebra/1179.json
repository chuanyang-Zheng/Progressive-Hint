    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Subtracting $8$ from both sides of the inequality, we have $$13x < 27.$$ Dividing both sides by $13$ gives $$x < \\frac{27}{13}.$$ Writing this in terms of mixed numbers, we have $$x < 2\\frac1{13}.$$ The largest integer satisfying this inequality is $x=\\boxed{2}$."
