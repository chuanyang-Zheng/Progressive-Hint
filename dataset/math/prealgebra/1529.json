    "problem": "What is the sum of the positive integers that are solutions of $-3n +3 >-11?$",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Adding $3n+11$ to both sides, we get $$-3n+3+3n+11 > -11+3n+11,$$ which simplifies to $$14 > 3n.$$ Dividing both sides by $3$ gives $$4\\frac 23 > n.$$ The integer solutions are $n=1,2,3,4$, and their sum is $\\boxed{10}$."
