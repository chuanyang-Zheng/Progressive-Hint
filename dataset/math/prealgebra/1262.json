    "problem": "John meant to divide a number by $2$, but he was careless and subtracted $2$ from the number instead.  He got an answer of $22$.  What would his answer have been had he actually divided by $2$ instead of subtracting $2$?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Let the number John was supposed to divide by 2 be $x$. We have the equation $x-2=22$, from which we find that $x=24$. Had John divided by 2, he would have gotten $x/2=24/2=12$. Thus, the answer John should have gotten is $\\boxed{12}$."
