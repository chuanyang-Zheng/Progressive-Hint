    "problem": "The five-digit number $N = 14{,}9AB$ is divisible by 12. Given that $A$ and $B$ are nonzero digits, what is the smallest possible value of $N$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "In order for $N$ to be divisible by 12, $N$ must be divisible by $4$ and $3$. That means the last two digits $AB$ must form a multiple of $4.$ Since $A$ and $B$ are nonzero digits, the smallest possible $14{,}9AB$ that is divisible by 4 is $14{,}912.$ Unfortunately, this number is not a multiple of $3$, since $1 + 4 + 9 + 1 + 2 = 17.$ However, our next possibility, $14{,}916,$ is a multiple of $3,$ since $1 + 4 + 9 + 1 + 6 = 21.$ Therefore, $\\boxed{14{,}916}$ is our answer."
