    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We multiply all three numbers together. There are two quick ways of doing this; both are shown below: $$11\\cdot 9 \\cdot 12 = (10 + 1)\\cdot 108 = 1080 + 108 = \\boxed{1188}$$$$11\\cdot 9 \\cdot 12 = 99\\cdot 12 = (100 - 1)\\cdot 12 = 1200 - 12 = \\boxed{1188}$$"
