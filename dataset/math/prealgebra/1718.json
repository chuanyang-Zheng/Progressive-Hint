    "problem": "Six horses eat 12 bales of hay in 12 hours. At the same rate, how many hours will 36 bales of hay last 12 horses?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "From the original rate, we note that 12 horses will eat 12 bales of hay in 6 hours. (Double the number of horses, half the time)  Therefore, 12 horses will eat 36 bales of hay in $\\boxed{18\\text{ hours}}$. (Triple the amount of hay, triple the time)"
