    "problem": "Think of a number. Double the number. Add 200. Divide the answer by 4. Subtract one-half the original number. What is the value of the result?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the number we think of.  We double $x$ to obtain $2x$, add 200 to find $2x+200$, divide by $4$ to find  \\[\n\\frac{2x+200}{4}=\\frac{2x}{4}+\\frac{200}{4}=\\frac{x}{2}+50.\n\\] After subtracting one-half of the original number, we are left with $\\boxed{50}$."
