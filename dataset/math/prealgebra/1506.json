    "problem": "What is the least positive integer value of $x$ for which the inequality $3x > 2x+1$ is true?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We isolate $x$ by subtracting $2x$ from each side: $x > 1$. It follows that the least positive integer value of $x$ greater than 1 is $\\boxed{2}$."
