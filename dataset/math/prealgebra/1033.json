    "problem": "If a 12-hour analog clock reads 8:00, what is the degree measure of the smaller angle formed by the minute and hour hands?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The hour hand is at $8$ and the minute hand is at $12$, which span 4 hours.  Each hour on the 12-hour analog clock spans $360/12=30$ degrees, so the angle formed here is $30\\cdot 4 = \\boxed{120}$ degrees."
