    "problem": "How many inches are in $3 \\tfrac{1}{4}$ yards?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We know that there are 12 inches in 1 foot, and that there are 3 feet in 1 yard. We can use these conversion factors to go from yards to inches: \\[ 3\\frac{1}{4}\\text{ yards}\\cdot\\frac{3\\text{ feet}}{1\\text{ yard}} \\cdot \\frac{12\\text{ inches}}{1\\text{ foot}} = \\boxed{117} \\text{ inches.}\\]"
