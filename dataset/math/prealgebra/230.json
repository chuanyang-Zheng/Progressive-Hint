    "problem": "How many odd perfect squares are between 5 and 211?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since $2^2 < 5 < 3^2$ and $13^2 < 211 < 15^2$, we have the list $3^2,5^2,7^2,\\ldots,13^2$, which has the same number of elements as $3,5,7,\\ldots,13$, which has $\\boxed{6}$ elements."
