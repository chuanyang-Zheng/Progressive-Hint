    "problem": "Two complementary angles, A and B, have measures in the ratio of 7 to 23, respectively. What is the ratio of the measure of the complement of angle A to the measure of the complement of angle B? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The complement of angle $A$ is just $B$, and the complement of $B$ is $A$.  So we seek the ratio of $B$ to $A$, which is reciprocal of $A$ to $B$, or just $\\boxed{\\frac{23}{7}}$."
