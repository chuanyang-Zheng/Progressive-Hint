    "problem": "A robot moving forward at a constant speed takes 2.5 hours to travel 1 kilometer. Moving forward at this same constant speed, it takes the robot 90 seconds to travel the length of a particular hallway. How many meters long is the hallway?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We see that 2.5 hours is the same as $2.5\\cdot 60 = 150$ minutes, or $150\\cdot 60 = 9000$ seconds.  This is 100 times longer than the robot was traveling the hallway, meaning the hallway is $\\frac{1}{100}$ kilometers, or $\\frac{1000}{100} = \\boxed{10}$ meters long."
