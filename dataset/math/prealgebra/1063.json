    "problem": "In a group of 30 high school students, 8 take French, 12 take Spanish and 3 take both languages. How many students of the group take neither French nor Spanish?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "A Venn diagram is helpful in explaining the solution. Let an oval patch represent the set of students taking French and another oval represent those taking Spanish. In the diagram, observe that the intersection (overlap) of the two oval patches represents the set of students taking both French and Spanish (see region B). We begin by placing 3 xs in region B, representing the students taking both French and Spanish. Region A represents the set taking French alone. Since the totals in regions A and B must be 8, we place 5 xs in region A. Similarly we place 9 xs in region C. D represents the set taking neither French nor Spanish. In the second Venn diagram, each x represents a student. Observe that the total number of xs in regions A, B, and C is 17. Therefore D has $30-17=\\boxed{13}$ students.\n\n[asy]\n\nsize(7cm,7cm);\n\ndraw(shift(0,0)*yscale(0.6)*Circle((0,0), 1));\n\ndraw(shift(1,0)*yscale(0.6)*Circle((0,0), 1));\n\ndraw((-2,-1)--(3,-1)--(3,1)--(-2,1)--(-2,-1));\n\nlabel(\"A\",(-0.5,0));\nlabel(\"B\",(0.5,0));\nlabel(\"C\",(1.5,0));\nlabel(\"D\",(2.3,-0.5));\n\nlabel(\"French\",(-1.2,0.7));\nlabel(\"Spanish\",(2,0.7));\n\n[/asy]\n\n\n\n[asy]\n\nsize(7cm,7cm);\n\ndraw(shift(0,0)*yscale(0.6)*Circle((0,0), 1));\n\ndraw(shift(1,0)*yscale(0.6)*Circle((0,0), 1));\n\ndraw((-2,-1)--(3,-1)--(3,1)--(-2,1)--(-2,-1));\n\nlabel(\"A\",(-0.5,0));\nlabel(\"B\",(0.5,0));\nlabel(\"C\",(1.5,0));\nlabel(\"D\",(2.3,-0.5));\n\nlabel(\"French\",(-1.2,0.7));\nlabel(\"Spanish\",(2,0.7));\n\nlabel(\"xxx\",(-0.2,-0.2));\nlabel(\"xx\",(-0.2,-0.4));\nlabel(\"xx\",(0.5,-0.2));\nlabel(\"x\",(0.5,-0.4));\nlabel(\"xxxxx\",(1.4,-0.2));\nlabel(\"xxxx\",(1.3,-0.4));\n\n[/asy]"
