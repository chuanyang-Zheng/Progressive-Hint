    "problem": "My classroom has 11 rows of chairs, with 11 chairs in each row.  The chairs in each row are numbered from 1 to 11.  How many chairs have odd numbers?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Each row has odd-numbered chairs $1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11$ for a total of 6 odd-numbered chairs in each row.  Since there are 11 rows, there are a total number of $11 \\times 6 = \\boxed{66}$ chairs with odd numbers."
