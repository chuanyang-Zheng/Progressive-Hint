    "problem": "How many of the following numbers are factors of 34 or multiples of 7?\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 14, 17, 29, 56, 91",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We can check each number one by one.\n\n1: 1 is a factor of 34 since $1\\cdot34=34$ .\n\n2: 2 is a factor of 34 since $2\\cdot17=34$ .\n\n3: 3 is not a factor of 34 since there is no number that can be multiplied by 3 to get 34. ( $34\\div3$ gives a quotient of 11 and a  remainder of 1.) There is also no number that can be multiplied by 7 to get 3 ( $3\\div7$ gives a quotient of 0 and a remainder 3.)\n\n4: 4 is not a factor of 34 since there is no number that can be multiplied by 4 to get 34.  ($34 \\div 4$ gives a quotient of 8 and a remainder of 2.)  There is also no number that can be multiplied by 7 to get 4.  ($4 \\div 7$ gives a quotient of 0 and a remainder of 4.)\n\n8:  8 is not a factor of 34 since there is no number that can multiply it to get 34 ( $34\\div8$ gives a quotient of 4 and a  remainder of 2) and is not a multiple of 7 since there is no number that can multiply 7 to get 8 ( $8\\div7$ gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder 1).\n\n14: 14 is a multiple of 7 since $7\\cdot2=14$ .\n\n17: 17 is a factor of 34 since $17\\cdot2=34$ .\n\n29: 29 is not a factor of 34, since there is no number that can multiply it to get 34 ( $34\\div29$ gives a quotient of 1 and a  remainder of 5) and is not a multiple of 7 since there is no number that can multiply 7 to get 29 ( $29\\div7$ gives a quotient of 4 and a remainder 1).\n\n56: 56 is a multiple of 7 since $7\\cdot8=56$ .\n\n91: 91 is a multiple of 7 since $7\\cdot13=91$ .\n\nSo, $\\boxed{6}$ of the 10 numbers are factors of 34 or multiples of 7."
