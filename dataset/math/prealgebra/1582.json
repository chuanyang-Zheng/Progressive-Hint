    "problem": "Victor and Kelsey have identical sandwiches. Victor eats $\\frac{2}{5}$ of his sandwich. If Kelsey eats $\\frac{15}{8}$ as much as Victor does, what fraction of her sandwich did she eat?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We need to find $\\frac{15}{8}$ of $\\frac{2}{5}.$ Since the word \"of\" means multiply, we need to find the product of these two fractions, $\\frac{15}{8} \\cdot \\frac{2}{5}.$ This equals $\\frac{15 \\cdot 2}{8 \\cdot 5} = \\frac{3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 2}{2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 5}$. Both the numerator and the denominator share common factors of 2 and 5, so they cancel: $\\frac{3 \\cdot \\cancel{5} \\cdot \\cancel{2}}{\\cancel{2} \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\cancel{5}} = \\frac{3}{2 \\cdot 2}$. Thus, we find the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}.$"
