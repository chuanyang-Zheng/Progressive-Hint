    "problem": "A circle is inscribed in a square with perimeter of 32 inches. What is the circumference of the circle, in inches? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The length of the diameter of the circle is equal to the square's side length.  The side length of the square is $(32\\text{ in.})/4=8$ inches. Therefore, the circumference of the circle is $\\pi\\cdot(8\\text{ in.})=\\boxed{8\\pi}$ inches."
