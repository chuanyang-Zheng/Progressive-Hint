    "problem": "Carla spent two-fifths of her savings on a bracelet and had $\\$ 9$ left over. How many dollars did Carla's bracelet cost?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Let $m$ be the original amount of Carla's savings, so that $\\$9 = \\frac{3m}{5}.$ It follows that $m= \\$15,$ and the bracelet cost $\\$15 - \\$9 = \\boxed{\\$6}.$"
