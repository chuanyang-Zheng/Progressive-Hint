    "problem": "A hot air balloon is 10 feet off the ground and is rising at a constant rate of 2 feet per second. What is the height of the balloon, in feet, after 25 more seconds?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "During these 25 seconds, the balloon will rise $2\\cdot25=50$ feet. The total height is then $10+50=\\boxed{60}$ feet."
