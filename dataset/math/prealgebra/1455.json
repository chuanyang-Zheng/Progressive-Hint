    "problem": "Three angles of a quadrilateral are $21^\\circ$, $ 66^\\circ$, and $134^\\circ$. How many degrees are in the measure of the fourth angle?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The measures of the angles of a quadrilateral sum to $360^\\circ$, so the fourth angle has measure \\[360^\\circ - 21^\\circ - 66^\\circ - 134^\\circ = \\boxed{139^\\circ}.\\]"
