    "problem": "A square and a triangle have the same area. If the square has a side length of 6 units and the triangle has a base of 8 units, what is the length, in units, of the altitude to that base of the triangle?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The area of the square is $6^2=36$ square units, which is also the area of the triangle. Since the area of the triangle is half the product of the base and the height, the height of triangle is $36/8\\cdot2=\\boxed{9}$ units."
