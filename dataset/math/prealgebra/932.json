    "problem": "How many terms of the sequence $\\sqrt{1},\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3},\\sqrt{4},\\ldots$ are less than or equal to $20$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "$20^2 = 400$, so each of the square roots up through $\\sqrt{400}$ is less than or equal to $20$. Thus, because the sequence starts at $1$, there are $\\boxed{400}$ such terms."
