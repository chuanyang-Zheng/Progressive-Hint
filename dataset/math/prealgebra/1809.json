    "problem": "A rectangular quilt's length is twice the length of a rectangular picture, and the quilt's width is three times the width of the same picture. The area of the picture is 2 square feet. What is the area of the quilt, in square feet?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since the quilt is twice as long, the area is twice as large when only considering that dimension.  Since it is also 3 times as wide, the area then triples (including the doubling of size due to the length).  Thus, the area of the quilt is $2 \\times 3 = 6$ times larger, making for an area of $\\boxed{12}$ square feet."
