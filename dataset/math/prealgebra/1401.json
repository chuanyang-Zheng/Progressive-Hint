    "problem": "Lucia flips a coin three times. What is the probability that she gets Head-Tail-Head, in that order? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "To count the total number of outcomes, we consider that there are three flips, and each one has two results, giving us $2^3 = 8$ possibilities. Head-Tail-Head is only one of these outcomes.  So, the probability of success is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{8}}$."
