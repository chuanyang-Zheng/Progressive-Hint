    "problem": "The ratio of dogs to cats at the pound is $4:3$. How many dogs were at the pound if a total of 280 dogs and cats were at the pound?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Let $4x$ be the number of dogs and $3x$ be the number of cats. Then $4x + 3x = 280$, or $7x = 280$. Solving, we get $x = 40$. Thus, the number of dogs is $4x = 4(40) = \\boxed{160}$."
