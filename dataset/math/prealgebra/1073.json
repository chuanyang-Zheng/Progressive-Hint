    "problem": "When you sketch a figure of an adult male, it is recommended that the head be $\\frac{1}{8}$ of the total height. If the full drawn height of a 6-foot man is 16 inches, how many inches should the drawing of his head be from top to bottom?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "It doesn't matter how tall the man actually is. We are told that the head should be $1/8$ of the total height, so $(1/8)(16) = \\boxed{2}$."
