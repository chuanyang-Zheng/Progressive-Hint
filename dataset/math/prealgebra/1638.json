    "problem": "If the square root of the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is 2 units, what is the sum of the squares of the length of the two other sides?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Let $c$ represent the length of the hypotenuse. We're told that $\\sqrt{c}=2$, so $c=4$. By the Pythagorean Theorem, the sum of the squares of the length of the two other sides equals the square of the length of the hypotenuse ($a^2+b^2=c^2$), so our answer is $c^2=\\boxed{16}$."
