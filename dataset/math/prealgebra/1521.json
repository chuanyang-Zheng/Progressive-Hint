    "problem": "The average of five weights is 13 grams. This set of five weights is then increased by another weight of 7 grams. What is the average of the six weights?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The average of the five weights is 13 gm. Then the total weight of the five weights is $5\\times13$ or 65 gm. The sixth weight increases the total to 72 gm. The average of the six weights is $\\frac{72}{6}$ or $\\boxed{12 \\text{ gm}}$."
