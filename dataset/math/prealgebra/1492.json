    "problem": "Sam the Sham is an unfair shoe salesman. He has a pair of shoes that was priced at $\\$60$ last week. To entice customers, he wants to put a \"$25\\%$ off'' tag on the shoes but he still wants the customer to pay $\\$60$ for the shoes. He raises the price of the shoes so that after the $25\\%$ discount the shoes will cost $\\$60$. In dollars, what must the new price of the shoes be before the discount?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Let the new price of the shoes be $x$. We are told that after a $25\\%$ discount, the shoes cost 60 dollars. Thus, $\\frac{3}{4}x = 60$. It follows that $x = \\boxed{80}$."
