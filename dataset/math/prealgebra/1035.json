    "problem": "Subtract the number of positive multiples of $3$ that are less than $20$ from the number of positive multiples of $6$ that are less than $20$.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The positive multiples of $3$ that are less than $20$ are $$3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18.$$The positive multiples of $6$ that are less than $20$ are $$6, 12, 18.$$Therefore, there are $6$ positive multiples of $3$ and $3$ positive multiples of $6$, so our final answer is    $$3 - 6 = -(6 - 3) = \\boxed{-3}.$$"
