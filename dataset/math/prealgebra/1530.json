    "solution": "The intersection of these lines creates a triangle shown in the figure. Starting from the vertex closest to angle 2 and moving clockwise, label the triangle's vertices $A$, $B$, and $C$. Since $\\angle ABC$ is a vertical angle of angle 1, it is equal to 50 degrees. Since $\\angle BCA$ is a right angle (the two lines intersecting to form the angle are perpendicular) and since the interior angles in the triangle sum to 180 degrees, $\\angle CAB = 180 - 90 - 50 = 40$ degrees. Since angle 2 is supplementary to $\\angle CAB$, angle 2 is equal to $180 - 40 = \\boxed{140}$ degrees."
