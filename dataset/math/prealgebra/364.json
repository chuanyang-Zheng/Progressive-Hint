    "problem": "Find the value of $x$ that satisfies the equation $4x+5 = 6x+7$.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Subtracting $4x$ from both sides, we get $5 = 2x+7$. Subtracting 7 from both sides, we get $ -2 = 2x$. Dividing both sides by 2 gives $ x = \\boxed{-1}$."
