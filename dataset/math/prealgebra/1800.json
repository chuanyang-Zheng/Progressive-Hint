    "problem": "If a stack of eight quarters is exactly half an inch, how many quarters will be needed to make a stack one foot high?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "There are $12$ inches in a foot, so we can convert the units by multiplying ratios. $$\\frac{8 \\text{ quarters}}{\\frac{1}{2}\\text{ inch}}\\times\\frac{12 \\text{ inches}}{1 \\text{ foot}}=\\frac{96}{\\frac12}=192 \\text{ quarters per foot}$$ A stack one foot high consists of $\\boxed{192}$ quarters."
