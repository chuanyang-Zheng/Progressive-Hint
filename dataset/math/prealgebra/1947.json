    "solution": "We will locate the numbers on the number line.  $4.5$ goes half way between $4$ and $5$ because $0.5=\\frac{5}{10}=\\frac{1}{2}.$.\n\nNote that $4.45$ goes half way between $4.4$ and $4.5$ because $$0.4=\\frac{4}{10}=\\frac{8}{20}, \\ \\ 0.5=\\frac{5}{10}=\\frac{10}{20}, \\ \\ \\text{and} \\ \\ 0.45=\\frac{9}{20}.$$Likewise, $0.45$ goes half way between $0.4$ and $0.5$ because $$0.4=\\frac{4}{10}=\\frac{8}{20}, \\ \\ 0.5=\\frac{5}{10}=\\frac{10}{20}, \\ \\ \\text{and} \\ \\ 0.45=\\frac{9}{20}.$$Finally, $0.54$ goes just a little bit less than halfway between $0.5$ and $0.6$ because $0.54$ is just a little bit smaller than $0.55,$ which is half way between $0.5$ and $0.6.$\n\nThus, we can plot all four numbers on the same number line as follows: [asy]\nsize(8cm); defaultpen(linewidth(0.7));\nreal eps=0.08; int k; int n=9;\ndraw((-0.5,0)--(5.5,0),Arrows(4.0));\nfor(k=0;k<=5;++k)\n\n{\n\ndraw((k,-eps)--(k,eps));\n\nlabel(\"$\"+string(k)+\"$\",(k,0),2.5*S);\n\n}\nfor(k=1;k<10;++k)\n\n{\n\ndraw((k/10,-eps/2)--(k/10,eps/2));\n\ndraw((4+k/10,-eps/2)--(4+k/10,eps/2));\n\n}\ndot(\"4.5\",(4.5,0),3*N,red);\ndot(\"4.45\",(4.45,0),3*S);\ndot(\"0.45\",(0.45,0),3*N,green);\ndot(\"0.54\",(0.54,0),3*S);\n[/asy] Therefore, the sum of the smallest and the largest numbers is $4.5 + 0.45 = \\boxed{4.95}.$"
