    "problem": "For how many two-digit positive integers does the product of the digits come out to 12?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "$12=2\\cdot6=3\\cdot4$, so the only two-digit positive integers the product of whose digits is 12 are 26, 62, 34, and 43, for a total of $\\boxed{4}$ integers."
