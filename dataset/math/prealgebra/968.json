    "problem": "In triangle $ABC$, the measure of angle $A$ is $x$ degrees, the measure of angle $B$ is $2x$ degrees and the measure of angle $C$ is $5x$ degrees. What is the value of $x$? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The sum of the interior angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so we have the equation $x+2x+5x=180$, so $x=\\boxed{22.5}$."
