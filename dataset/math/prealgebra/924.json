    "problem": "The number 4 is written on my whiteboard. Every time it rains, I multiply the number on the whiteboard by $\\frac{2}{3}$, erase the original number, and write the new number on the whiteboard. When it snows, I multiply the number on the whiteboard by $\\frac{3}{5}$, and I replace the original number with the new number. It has rained 5 times and snowed 4 times this month. At the end of the month, what number is on the whiteboard?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since it has rained 5 times, I have multiplied by $\\frac{2}{3}$ a total of 5 times. This is the same as multiplying by $\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^5$, by definition of the exponent. Similarly, I have multiplied by $\\frac{3}{5}$ four times, or multiplied by $\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^4$.\n\nBecause I started with 4 on the whiteboard at the beginning of the month, the number on the board at the end of the month is $\\displaystyle 4\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^5\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^4$.\n\nWe know that $\\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right)^n=\\frac{a^n}{b^n}$, so we have  $$4\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^5\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^4=4\\left(\\frac{2^5}{3^5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3^4}{5^4}\\right).$$We can make this calculation simpler by rewriting the expression and using the exponent law $\\frac{a^m}{a^n}=a^{m-n}$, as shown below: \\begin{align*} 4\\left(\\frac{2^5}{3^5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3^4}{5^4}\\right)&=\\left(\\frac{4\\cdot2^5}{5^4}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3^4}{3^5}\\right) \\\\ &=\\left(\\frac{4\\cdot2^5}{5^4}\\right)\\left(3^{-1}\\right)=\\left(\\frac{4\\cdot2^5}{5^4}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right). \\end{align*}Now we evaluate the remaining expressions: $$\\left(\\frac{4\\cdot2^5}{5^4}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)=\\frac{4\\cdot32}{625}\\cdot\\frac{1}{3}=\\boxed{\\frac{128}{1875}}.$$"
