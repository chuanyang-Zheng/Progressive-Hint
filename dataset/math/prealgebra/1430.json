    "problem": "What is the largest prime factor of 1391?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since $91 = 13\\cdot 7$, we find that \\[1391 = 1300 + 91 = 13\\cdot 100 + 13\\cdot 7 = 13(100+7) = 13\\cdot 107.\\]Since 107 is prime, the largest prime factor of 1391 is $\\boxed{107}$."
