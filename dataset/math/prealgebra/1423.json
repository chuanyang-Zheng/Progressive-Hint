    "problem": "Charlie is riding on his unicycle. If the unicycle's wheel has a radius of 9 inches and makes 2 revolutions every 3 seconds, what is the unicycle's speed in inches per second?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We need to know how many inches are in one revolution of the unicycle's wheel. In other words, we need to know the circumference of the wheel. Since the radius is $9$ inches, the circumference is $18\\pi$ inches. So, if there are $18\\pi$ inches in one revolution, and the wheel makes $2$ revolutions every $3$ seconds, the unicycle's speed is $18\\pi\\cdot\\frac{2}{3} = \\boxed{12\\pi}$ inches per second."
