    "problem": "What is the greatest integer that satisfies $6 - x > -9$ ?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Adding $x+9$ to both sides gives $$6-x+x+9 > -9+x+9,$$ then simplifying gives $$15 > x.$$ The greatest integer satisfying this inequality is $x=\\boxed{14}$."
