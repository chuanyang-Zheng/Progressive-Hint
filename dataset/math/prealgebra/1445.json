    "problem": "At Annville Junior High School, $30\\%$ of the students in the Math Club are in the Science Club, and $80\\%$ of the students in the Science Club are in the Math Club. There are 15 students in the Science Club. How many students are in the Math Club?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since $80\\%$ of the Science Club members are also in the Math Club, there are $0.8(15)=12$ students common to both clubs. Because $30\\%$ of the students in the Math Club are also in the Science Club, there are $12\\div 0.3=\\boxed{40}$ students in the Math Club.
