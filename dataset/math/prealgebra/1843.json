    "problem": "Simplify $\\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{3}.$",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We want to have the least common denominator, $6$, in the denominator when we add the two fractions. $\\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{2}{2} = \\frac{2}{6}$.\n\nAdding this to $\\frac{1}{6}$, we obtain $\\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{3}{6}$, which can be simplified further since $3$ and $6$ have a common divisor, $3$.  Dividing both the numerator and denominator by $3$, we find that $\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$, which is in the most simplified form. So, $\\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$."
