    "problem": "Thirty-five students attend a math club meeting. The number of girls at the meeting is a multiple of 13, and there are more girls than boys attending the meeting. How many boys are at the meeting?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We assume the number of girls is a nonnegative integer and no greater than 35. The nonnegative multiples of 13 less than 35 are 0, 13 and 26. As the number of girls is greater than the number of boys, the only valid choice is for there to be 26 girls. That leaves $35-26 = \\boxed{9}$ boys at the meeting."
