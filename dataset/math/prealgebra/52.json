    "problem": "While walking on a plane surface, a traveler first headed 19 miles north, then 16 miles west, then 3 miles south and finally 4 miles east. How many miles from the starting point was the traveler after these four legs of the journey?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "In total, the traveler went 16 miles north and 12 miles west. This forms a 12-16-20 (3-4-5) Pythagorean triple, so the traveler is $\\boxed{20}$ miles away from the starting point."
