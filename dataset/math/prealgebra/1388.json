    "problem": "Half the value of $3x-9$ is $x+37$. What is the value of $x$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We translate the problem to the equation $\\frac{1}{2}(3x-9) = x+37$. Multiplying both sides by 2 gives $3x-9 = 2x+74$. Subtracting $2x$ from both sides yield $x-9 = 74$. Adding $9$ to both sides yields $ x = \\boxed{83}$."
