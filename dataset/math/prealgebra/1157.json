    "problem": "There are two pints in one quart and four quarts in one gallon. How many pints are there in $2\\frac{1}{2}$ gallons of milk?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since there are two pints in each quart and four quarts in a gallon, there are $2\\times4=8$ pints in each gallon.  Multiplying 8 by $2\\frac{1}{2}$, we find that there are $\\boxed{20}$ pints in $2\\frac{1}{2}$ gallons."
