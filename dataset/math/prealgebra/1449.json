    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "To start, find a common denominator on the left side.  The lowest common multiple of 3 and 4 is 12, so this is the common denominator.  Rewrite the equation as: $$\\frac{4x}{12}+\\frac{3x}{12}=14$$$$\\frac{4x+3x}{12}=14$$$$\\frac{7x}{12}=14$$Now, multiply both sides of the equation by $\\frac{12}{7}$ to solve for $x$: $$\\frac{7x}{12}\\cdot\\frac{12}{7}=14\\cdot \\frac{12}{7}$$$$x=2\\cdot 12=\\boxed{24}$$"
