    "problem": "Tamara knows that the arithmetic mean of her five quiz scores is 95$\\%$. However, she has misplaced one of these quizzes. The ones she can find have scores of 100$\\%$, 100$\\%$, 99$\\%$ and 98$\\%$. What is her score on the misplaced quiz?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Let $x$ equal the unknown quiz score.  We know the average of all the scores is 95, which gives the expression: $$\\frac{100+100+99+98+x}{5}=95$$ $$100+100+99+98+x=475$$ $$x=475-397=\\boxed{78}$$"
