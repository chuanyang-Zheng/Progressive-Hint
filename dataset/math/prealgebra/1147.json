    "problem": "The data in the stem and leaf plot shown are the long jump distances, in centimeters, that the girls team of Pseudo H.S. made at practice today. $(51|1$ represents $511$ centimeters$.)$ What is the sum of the median and mode of the data?\n\n\\begin{tabular}{l|lllll}\n51& 1\\\\\n52&\\\\\n53& 2& 5\\\\\n54& 0& 2& 2& 5\\\\\n55& 0& 1& 3& 4& 7\\\\\n56& 0& 2& 5\\\\\n57& 0& 1\\\\\n\\end{tabular}",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The median of the data is $55|1,$ or $551.$ The mode of the data is $54|2,$ or $542.$ Thus, the sum of the median and the mode is $551 + 542 = \\boxed{1093}$ centimeters."
