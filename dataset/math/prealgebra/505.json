    "problem": "Solve for $x$: $\\frac{x}2 + \\frac{x}3 = 5$",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Writing the left-hand side with a common denominator, we have$$\\dfrac{x}{2} + \\dfrac{x}{3} = \\dfrac{3x}{6} + \\dfrac{2x}{6} = \\dfrac{5x}{6},$$ so our equation is $$\\dfrac{5x}{6} = 5.$$Multiplying both sides by $\\dfrac{6}{5}$ gives $$x = 5\\cdot \\dfrac{6}{5} = \\boxed{6}.$$"
