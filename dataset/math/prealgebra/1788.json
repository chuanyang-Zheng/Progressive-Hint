    "problem": "How many four-digit, positive integers are there where each digit is a prime number?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "There are four one-digit numbers that are prime: 2, 3, 5, and 7. For each of the four digits of our positive integer, we can choose any one of these four numbers. There are thus $4^4 = \\boxed{256}$ such integers."
